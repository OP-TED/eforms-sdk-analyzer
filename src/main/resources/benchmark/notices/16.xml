      <cbc:Name languageID="ENG">Poor Things SDK 1.10 </cbc:Name>
      <cbc:Description languageID="ENG">Poor Things is a 2023 surrealist[3] steampunk[4][5] black comedy film directed by Yorgos Lanthimos from a screenplay by Tony McNamara.[6] It is based on the 1992 novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, and stars Emma Stone alongside Mark Ruffalo, Willem Dafoe, Ramy Youssef, Christopher Abbott, and Jerrod Carmichael. The plot follows a young Victorian woman who, after being crudely resurrected by a scientist following her suicide, runs off with a debauched lawyer to embark on an odyssey of self-discovery and sexual liberation.
Development on the film began as early as 2009, when Lanthimos visited Gray in his Scotland home to acquire the rights to the novel. Following a period in development hell, the director revisited Poor Things while filming The Favourite (2018), which starred Stone, and approached her with the lead role. The remaining cast joined the project in 2021, with principal photography occurring in Hungary from August to December of that year.
Poor Things premiered at the 80th Venice International Film Festival on September 1, 2023, where it won the Golden Lion. The film is scheduled to be theatrically released by Searchlight Pictures in the United States on December 8, 2023, and in the United Kingdom on January 12, 2024.</cbc:Description>

A young woman, Bella, is brought back to life by her guardian, the scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter. Initially naïve, Bella is eager to learn about the world around her, albeit under Baxter's protection. Wanting to see more, she runs off with Duncan Wedderburn, a slick and debauched lawyer, and travels across continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella demands equality and liberation.[7]
Development
Lanthimos read Poor Things years prior to developing the film and met with the author, Alasdair Gray, in Scotland to acquire the rights. "He was a very lovely man," Lanthimos shared, "Unfortunately, he died just a couple of years before we actually made the film, but he was very special and energetic; he was 80-something [when we met], and as soon as I got there, he had seen Dogtooth and said, 'I had my friend put on the DVD, because I don’t know how to operate these things, but I think you're very talented, young man.'" Lanthimos shared that Gray took him on a personal tour of Glasgow, where Gray showed Lanthimos several places that he had incorporated into the story.[citation needed]
While filming The Favourite (2018), Lanthimos revisited the project, which he discussed with Emma Stone, who also starred in the film. Lanthimos began developing Poor Things more actively following the success of The Favourite: “After the relative success of The Favourite, where I actually made a slightly more expensive film that was successful, people were more inclined to allow me to do whatever it is that I wanted, so I just went back to Gray’s book and said, ‘This is what I want to do.’ It was a long process, but the book was always on my mind.” While developing the film, Lanthimos and Stone collaborated with each other on the short film Bleat (2022).[8]
Pre-production
Poor Things was officially announced in February 2021.[9] Lanthimos felt that working with Stone again gave him an advantage to the production, as they developed a mutual trust towards one another. Stone also discussed how the process of making Poor Things was different in comparison to The Favourite, due to also acting as a producer: “It was so interesting to be involved in how the film was being pieced together, from cast to department heads to what have you. Ultimately, Yorgos was the one making those decisions, but I was very involved in the process, which started during the pandemic; we were reaching out to people and casting and everything during that time, because we couldn’t go anywhere.”[10]</cbc:Description>

"He was a very lovely man," Lanthimos shared, "Unfortunately, he died just a couple of years before we actually made the film, but he was very special and energetic; he was 80-something [when we met], and as soon as I got there, he had seen Dogtooth and said, 'I had my friend put on the DVD, because I don’t know how to operate these things, but I think you're very talented, young man.'" Lanthimos shared that Gray took him on a personal tour of Glasgow, where Gray showed Lanthimos several places that he had incorporated into the story.[citation needed]
While filming The Favourite (2018), Lanthimos revisited the project, which he discussed with Emma Stone, who also starred in the film. Lanthimos began developing Poor Things more actively following the success of The Favourite: “After the relative success of The Favourite, where I actually made a slightly more expensive film that was successful, people were more inclined to allow me to do whatever it is that I wanted, so I just went back to Gray’s book and said, ‘This is what I want to do.’ It was a long process, but the book was always on my mind.” While developing the film, Lanthimos and Stone collaborated with each other on the short film Bleat (2022).[8]
Pre-production
Poor Things was officially announced in February 2021.[9] Lanthimos felt that working with Stone again gave him an advantage to the production, as they developed a mutual trust towards one another. Stone also discussed how the process of making Poor Things was different in comparison to The Favourite, due to also acting as a producer: “It was so interesting to be involved in how the film was being pieced together, from cast to department heads to what have you. Ultimately, Yorgos was the one making those decisions, but I was very involved in the process, which started during the pandemic; we were reaching out to people and casting and everything during that time, because we couldn’t go anywhere.”[10]</cbc:Description>

				Premise
				A young woman, Bella, is brought back to life by her guardian, the scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter. Initially naïve, Bella is eager to learn about the world around her, albeit under Baxter's protection. Wanting to see more, she runs off with Duncan Wedderburn, a slick and debauched lawyer, and travels across continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella demands equality and liberation.[7]

				Premise
				A young woman, Bella, is brought back to life by her guardian, the scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter. Initially naïve, Bella is eager to learn about the world around her, albeit under Baxter's protection. Wanting to see more, she runs off with Duncan Wedderburn, a slick and debauched lawyer, and travels across continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella demands equality and liberation.[7]
				Development
				Lanthimos read Poor Things years prior to developing the film and met with the author, Alasdair Gray, in Scotland to acquire the rights. "He was a very lovely man," Lanthimos shared, "Unfortunately, he died just a couple of years before we actually made the film, but he was very special and energetic; he was 80-something [when we met], and as soon as I got there, he had seen Dogtooth and said, 'I had my friend put on the DVD, because I don’t know how to operate these things, but I think you're very talented, young man.'" Lanthimos shared that Gray took him on a personal tour of Glasgow, where Gray showed Lanthimos several places that he had incorporated into the story.[citation needed]
				While filming The Favourite (2018), Lanthimos revisited the project, which he discussed with Emma Stone, who also starred in the film. Lanthimos began developing Poor Things more actively following the success of The Favourite: “After the relative success of The Favourite, where I actually made a slightly more expensive film that was successful, people were more inclined to allow me to do whatever it is that I wanted, so I just went back to Gray’s book and said, ‘This is what I want to do.’ It was a long process, but the book was always on my mind.” While developing the film, Lanthimos and Stone collaborated with each other on the short film Bleat (2022).[8]
				Pre-production
				Poor Things was officially announced in February 2021.[9] Lanthimos felt that working with Stone again gave him an advantage to the production, as they developed a mutual trust towards one another. Stone also discussed how the process of making Poor Things was different in comparison to The Favourite, due to also acting as a producer: “It was so interesting to be involved in how the film was being pieced together, from cast to department heads to what have you. Ultimately, Yorgos was the one making those decisions, but I was very involved in the process, which started during the pandemic; we were reaching out to people and casting and everything during that time, because we couldn’t go anywhere.”[10]

Lanthimos began developing Poor Things more actively following the success of The Favourite: “After the relative success of The Favourite, where I actually made a slightly more expensive film that was successful, people were more inclined to allow me to do whatever it is that I wanted, so I just went back to Gray’s book and said, ‘This is what I want to do.’ It was a long process, but the book was always on my mind.” While developing the film, Lanthimos and Stone collaborated with each other on the short film Bleat (2022).[8]
				Pre-production
				Poor Things was officially announced in February 2021.[9] Lanthimos felt that working with Stone again gave him an advantage to the production, as they developed a mutual trust towards one another. Stone also discussed how the process of making Poor Things was different in comparison to The Favourite, due to also acting as a producer: “It was so interesting to be involved in how the film was being pieced together, from cast to department heads to what have you. Ultimately, Yorgos was the one making those decisions, but I was very involved in the process, which started during the pandemic; we were reaching out to people and casting and everything during that time, because we couldn’t go anywhere.”[10]

				Premise
				A young woman, Bella, is brought back to life by her guardian, the scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter. Initially naïve, Bella is eager to learn about the world around her, albeit under Baxter's protection. Wanting to see more, she runs off with Duncan Wedderburn, a slick and debauched lawyer, and travels across continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella demands equality and liberation.[7]

"He was a very lovely man," Lanthimos shared, "Unfortunately, he died just a couple of years before we actually made the film, but he was very special and energetic; he was 80-something [when we met], and as soon as I got there, he had seen Dogtooth and said, 'I had my friend put on the DVD, because I don’t know how to operate these things, but I think you're very talented, young man.'"

				Premise
				A young woman, Bella, is brought back to life by her guardian, the scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter. Initially naïve, Bella is eager to learn about the world around her, albeit under Baxter's protection. Wanting to see more, she runs off with Duncan Wedderburn, a slick and debauched lawyer, and travels across continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella demands equality and liberation.[7]
				Development
				Lanthimos read Poor Things years prior to developing the film and met with the author, Alasdair Gray, in Scotland to acquire the rights. "He was a very lovely man," Lanthimos shared, "Unfortunately, he died just a couple of years before we actually made the film, but he was very special and energetic; he was 80-something [when we met], and as soon as I got there, he had seen Dogtooth and said, 'I had my friend put on the DVD, because I don’t know how to operate these things, but I think you're very talented, young man.'" Lanthimos shared that Gray took him on a personal tour of Glasgow, where Gray showed Lanthimos several places that he had incorporated into the story.[citation needed]
				While filming The Favourite (2018), Lanthimos revisited the project, which he discussed with Emma Stone, who also starred in the film. Lanthimos began developing Poor Things more actively following the success of The Favourite: “After the relative success of The Favourite, where I actually made a slightly more expensive film that was successful, people were more inclined to allow me to do whatever it is that I wanted, so I just went back to Gray’s book and said, ‘This is what I want to do.’ It was a long process, but the book was always on my mind.” While developing the film, Lanthimos and Stone collaborated with each other on the short film Bleat (2022).[8]
				Pre-production
				Poor Things was officially announced in February 2021.[9] Lanthimos felt that working with Stone again gave him an advantage to the production, as they developed a mutual trust towards one another. Stone also discussed how the process of making Poor Things was different in comparison to The Favourite, due to also acting as a producer: “It was so interesting to be involved in how the film was being pieced together, from cast to department heads to what have you. Ultimately, Yorgos was the one making those decisions, but I was very involved in the process, which started during the pandemic; we were reaching out to people and casting and everything during that time, because we couldn’t go anywhere.”[10]

Ultimately, Yorgos was the one making those decisions, but I was very involved in the process, which started during the pandemic; we were reaching out to people and casting and everything during that time, because we couldn’t go anywhere.”[10]

				Premise
				A young woman, Bella, is brought back to life by her guardian, the scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter. Initially naïve, Bella is eager to learn about the world around her, albeit under Baxter's protection. Wanting to see more, she runs off with Duncan Wedderburn, a slick and debauched lawyer, and travels across continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella demands equality and liberation.[7]
				Development
				Lanthimos read Poor Things years prior to developing the film and met with the author, Alasdair Gray, in Scotland to acquire the rights. "He was a very lovely man," Lanthimos shared, "Unfortunately, he died just a couple of years before we actually made the film, but he was very special and energetic; he was 80-something [when we met], and as soon as I got there, he had seen Dogtooth and said, 'I had my friend put on the DVD, because I don’t know how to operate these things, but I think you're very talented, young man.'" Lanthimos shared that Gray took him on a personal tour of Glasgow, where Gray showed Lanthimos several places that he had incorporated into the story.[citation needed]
				While filming The Favourite (2018), Lanthimos revisited the project, which he discussed with Emma Stone, who also starred in the film. Lanthimos began developing Poor Things more actively following the success of The Favourite: “After the relative success of The Favourite, where I actually made a slightly more expensive film that was successful, people were more inclined to allow me to do whatever it is that I wanted, so I just went back to Gray’s book and said, ‘This is what I want to do.’ It was a long process, but the book was always on my mind.” While developing the film, Lanthimos and Stone collaborated with each other on the short film Bleat (2022).[8]

			<cbc:Description languageID="ENG">
				Premise
				A young woman, Bella, is brought back to life by her guardian, the scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter. Initially naïve, Bella is eager to learn about the world around her, albeit under Baxter's protection. Wanting to see more, she runs off with Duncan Wedderburn, a slick and debauched lawyer, and travels across continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella demands equality and liberation.[7]
				Development
				Lanthimos read Poor Things years prior to developing the film and met with the author, Alasdair Gray, in Scotland to acquire the rights. "He was a very lovely man," Lanthimos shared, "Unfortunately, he died just a couple of years before we actually made the film, but he was very special and energetic; he was 80-something [when we met], and as soon as I got there, he had seen Dogtooth and said, 'I had my friend put on the DVD, because I don’t know how to operate these things, but I think you're very talented, young man.'" Lanthimos shared that Gray took him on a personal tour of Glasgow, where Gray showed Lanthimos several places that he had incorporated into the story.[citation needed]
				While filming The Favourite (2018), Lanthimos revisited the project, which he discussed with Emma Stone, who also starred in the film. Lanthimos began developing Poor Things more actively following the success of The Favourite: “After the relative success of The Favourite, where I actually made a slightly more expensive film that was successful, people were more inclined to allow me to do whatever it is that I wanted, so I just went back to Gray’s book and said, ‘This is what I want to do.’ It was a long process, but the book was always on my mind.” While developing the film, Lanthimos and Stone collaborated with each other on the short film Bleat (2022).[8]
				Pre-production
				Poor Things was officially announced in February 2021.[9] Lanthimos felt that working with Stone again gave him an advantage to the production, as they developed a mutual trust towards one another. Stone also discussed how the process of making Poor Things was different in comparison to The Favourite, due to also acting as a producer: “It was so interesting to be involved in how the film was being pieced together, from cast to department heads to what have you. Ultimately, Yorgos was the one making those decisions, but I was very involved in the process, which started during the pandemic; we were reaching out to people and casting and everything during that time, because we couldn’t go anywhere.”[10]

			<cbc:Description languageID="ENG">
				Premise
				A young woman, Bella, is brought back to life by her guardian, the scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter. Initially naïve, Bella is eager to learn about the world around her, albeit under Baxter's protection. Wanting to see more, she runs off with Duncan Wedderburn, a slick and debauched lawyer, and travels across continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella demands equality and liberation.[7]
				Development
				Lanthimos read Poor Things years prior to developing the film and met with the author, Alasdair Gray, in Scotland to acquire the rights. "He was a very lovely man," Lanthimos shared, "Unfortunately, he died just a couple of years before we actually made the film, but he was very special and energetic; he was 80-something [when we met], and as soon as I got there, he had seen Dogtooth and said, 'I had my friend put on the DVD, because I don’t know how to operate these things, but I think you're very talented, young man.'" Lanthimos shared that Gray took him on a personal tour of Glasgow, where Gray showed Lanthimos several places that he had incorporated into the story.[citation needed]
				While filming The Favourite (2018), Lanthimos revisited the project, which he discussed with Emma Stone, who also starred in the film. Lanthimos began developing Poor Things more actively following the success of The Favourite: “After the relative success of The Favourite, where I actually made a slightly more expensive film that was successful, people were more inclined to allow me to do whatever it is that I wanted, so I just went back to Gray’s book and said, ‘This is what I want to do.’ It was a long process, but the book was always on my mind.” While developing the film, Lanthimos and Stone collaborated with each other on the short film Bleat (2022).[8]
				Pre-production
				Poor Things was officially announced in February 2021.[9] Lanthimos felt that working with Stone again gave him an advantage to the production, as they developed a mutual trust towards one another. Stone also discussed how the process of making Poor Things was different in comparison to The Favourite, due to also acting as a producer: “It was so interesting to be involved in how the film was being pieced together, from cast to department heads to what have you. Ultimately, Yorgos was the one making those decisions, but I was very involved in the process, which started during the pandemic; we were reaching out to people and casting and everything during that time, because we couldn’t go anywhere.”[10]

				A young woman, Bella, is brought back to life by her guardian, the scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter. Initially naïve, Bella is eager to learn about the world around her, albeit under Baxter's protection. Wanting to see more, she runs off with Duncan Wedderburn, a slick and debauched lawyer, and travels across continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella demands equality and liberation.[7]
				Development
				Lanthimos read Poor Things years prior to developing the film and met with the author, Alasdair Gray, in Scotland to acquire the rights. "He was a very lovely man," Lanthimos shared, "Unfortunately, he died just a couple of years before we actually made the film, but he was very special and energetic; he was 80-something [when we met], and as soon as I got there, he had seen Dogtooth and said, 'I had my friend put on the DVD, because I don’t know how to operate these things, but I think you're very talented, young man.'" Lanthimos shared that Gray took him on a personal tour of Glasgow, where Gray showed Lanthimos several places that he had incorporated into the story.[citation needed]
				While filming The Favourite (2018), Lanthimos revisited the project, which he discussed with Emma Stone, who also starred in the film. Lanthimos began developing Poor Things more actively following the success of The Favourite: “After the relative success of The Favourite, where I actually made a slightly more expensive film that was successful, people were more inclined to allow me to do whatever it is that I wanted, so I just went back to Gray’s book and said, ‘This is what I want to do.’ It was a long process, but the book was always on my mind.” While developing the film, Lanthimos and Stone collaborated with each other on the short film Bleat (2022).[8]
				Pre-production
				Poor Things was officially announced in February 2021.[9] Lanthimos felt that working with Stone again gave him an advantage to the production, as they developed a mutual trust towards one another. Stone also discussed how the process of making Poor Things was different in comparison to The Favourite, due to also acting as a producer: “It was so interesting to be involved in how the film was being pieced together, from cast to department heads to what have you. Ultimately, Yorgos was the one making those decisions, but I was very involved in the process, which started during the pandemic; we were reaching out to people and casting and everything during that time, because we couldn’t go anywhere.”[10]

				Premise
				A young woman, Bella, is brought back to life by her guardian, the scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter. Initially naïve, Bella is eager to learn about the world around her, albeit under Baxter's protection. Wanting to see more, she runs off with Duncan Wedderburn, a slick and debauched lawyer, and travels across continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella demands equality and liberation.[7]
				Development
				Lanthimos read Poor Things years prior to developing the film and met with the author, Alasdair Gray, in Scotland to acquire the rights. "He was a very lovely man," Lanthimos shared, "Unfortunately, he died just a couple of years before we actually made the film, but he was very special and energetic; he was 80-something [when we met], and as soon as I got there, he had seen Dogtooth and said, 'I had my friend put on the DVD, because I don’t know how to operate these things, but I think you're very talented, young man.'" Lanthimos shared that Gray took him on a personal tour of Glasgow, where Gray showed Lanthimos several places that he had incorporated into the story.[citation needed]
				While filming The Favourite (2018), Lanthimos revisited the project, which he discussed with Emma Stone, who also starred in the film. Lanthimos began developing Poor Things more actively following the success of The Favourite: “After the relative success of The Favourite, where I actually made a slightly more expensive film that was successful, people were more inclined to allow me to do whatever it is that I wanted, so I just went back to Gray’s book and said, ‘This is what I want to do.’ It was a long process, but the book was always on my mind.” While developing the film, Lanthimos and Stone collaborated with each other on the short film Bleat (2022).[8]
				Pre-production
				Poor Things was officially announced in February 2021.[9] Lanthimos felt that working with Stone again gave him an advantage to the production, as they developed a mutual trust towards one another. Stone also discussed how the process of making Poor Things was different in comparison to The Favourite, due to also acting as a producer: “It was so interesting to be involved in how the film was being pieced together, from cast to department heads to what have you. Ultimately, Yorgos was the one making those decisions, but I was very involved in the process, which started during the pandemic; we were reaching out to people and casting and everything during that time, because we couldn’t go anywhere.”[10]

Lanthimos began developing Poor Things more actively following the success of The Favourite: “After the relative success of The Favourite, where I actually made a slightly more expensive film that was successful, people were more inclined to allow me to do whatever it is that I wanted, so I just went back to Gray’s book and said, ‘This is what I want to do.’ It was a long process, but the book was always on my mind.” While developing the film, Lanthimos and Stone collaborated with each other on the short film Bleat (2022).[8]
				Pre-production
				Poor Things was officially announced in February 2021.[9] Lanthimos felt that working with Stone again gave him an advantage to the production, as they developed a mutual trust towards one another. Stone also discussed how the process of making Poor Things was different in comparison to The Favourite, due to also acting as a producer: “It was so interesting to be involved in how the film was being pieced together, from cast to department heads to what have you. Ultimately, Yorgos was the one making those decisions, but I was very involved in the process, which started during the pandemic; we were reaching out to people and casting and everything during that time, because we couldn’t go anywhere.”[10]

				Premise
				A young woman, Bella, is brought back to life by her guardian, the scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter. Initially naïve, Bella is eager to learn about the world around her, albeit under Baxter's protection. Wanting to see more, she runs off with Duncan Wedderburn, a slick and debauched lawyer, and travels across continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella demands equality and liberation.[7]

"He was a very lovely man," Lanthimos shared, "Unfortunately, he died just a couple of years before we actually made the film, but he was very special and energetic; he was 80-something [when we met], and as soon as I got there, he had seen Dogtooth and said, 'I had my friend put on the DVD, because I don’t know how to operate these things, but I think you're very talented, young man.'"

				Premise
				A young woman, Bella, is brought back to life by her guardian, the scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter. Initially naïve, Bella is eager to learn about the world around her, albeit under Baxter's protection. Wanting to see more, she runs off with Duncan Wedderburn, a slick and debauched lawyer, and travels across continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella demands equality and liberation.[7]
				Development
				Lanthimos read Poor Things years prior to developing the film and met with the author, Alasdair Gray, in Scotland to acquire the rights. "He was a very lovely man," Lanthimos shared, "Unfortunately, he died just a couple of years before we actually made the film, but he was very special and energetic; he was 80-something [when we met], and as soon as I got there, he had seen Dogtooth and said, 'I had my friend put on the DVD, because I don’t know how to operate these things, but I think you're very talented, young man.'" Lanthimos shared that Gray took him on a personal tour of Glasgow, where Gray showed Lanthimos several places that he had incorporated into the story.[citation needed]
				While filming The Favourite (2018), Lanthimos revisited the project, which he discussed with Emma Stone, who also starred in the film. Lanthimos began developing Poor Things more actively following the success of The Favourite: “After the relative success of The Favourite, where I actually made a slightly more expensive film that was successful, people were more inclined to allow me to do whatever it is that I wanted, so I just went back to Gray’s book and said, ‘This is what I want to do.’ It was a long process, but the book was always on my mind.” While developing the film, Lanthimos and Stone collaborated with each other on the short film Bleat (2022).[8]
				Pre-production
				Poor Things was officially announced in February 2021.[9] Lanthimos felt that working with Stone again gave him an advantage to the production, as they developed a mutual trust towards one another. Stone also discussed how the process of making Poor Things was different in comparison to The Favourite, due to also acting as a producer: “It was so interesting to be involved in how the film was being pieced together, from cast to department heads to what have you. Ultimately, Yorgos was the one making those decisions, but I was very involved in the process, which started during the pandemic; we were reaching out to people and casting and everything during that time, because we couldn’t go anywhere.”[10]

Ultimately, Yorgos was the one making those decisions, but I was very involved in the process, which started during the pandemic; we were reaching out to people and casting and everything during that time, because we couldn’t go anywhere.”[10]

				Premise
				A young woman, Bella, is brought back to life by her guardian, the scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter. Initially naïve, Bella is eager to learn about the world around her, albeit under Baxter's protection. Wanting to see more, she runs off with Duncan Wedderburn, a slick and debauched lawyer, and travels across continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella demands equality and liberation.[7]
				Development
				Lanthimos read Poor Things years prior to developing the film and met with the author, Alasdair Gray, in Scotland to acquire the rights. "He was a very lovely man," Lanthimos shared, "Unfortunately, he died just a couple of years before we actually made the film, but he was very special and energetic; he was 80-something [when we met], and as soon as I got there, he had seen Dogtooth and said, 'I had my friend put on the DVD, because I don’t know how to operate these things, but I think you're very talented, young man.'" Lanthimos shared that Gray took him on a personal tour of Glasgow, where Gray showed Lanthimos several places that he had incorporated into the story.[citation needed]
				While filming The Favourite (2018), Lanthimos revisited the project, which he discussed with Emma Stone, who also starred in the film. Lanthimos began developing Poor Things more actively following the success of The Favourite: “After the relative success of The Favourite, where I actually made a slightly more expensive film that was successful, people were more inclined to allow me to do whatever it is that I wanted, so I just went back to Gray’s book and said, ‘This is what I want to do.’ It was a long process, but the book was always on my mind.” While developing the film, Lanthimos and Stone collaborated with each other on the short film Bleat (2022).[8]

			<cbc:Description languageID="ENG">
				Premise
				A young woman, Bella, is brought back to life by her guardian, the scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter. Initially naïve, Bella is eager to learn about the world around her, albeit under Baxter's protection. Wanting to see more, she runs off with Duncan Wedderburn, a slick and debauched lawyer, and travels across continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella demands equality and liberation.[7]
				Development
				Lanthimos read Poor Things years prior to developing the film and met with the author, Alasdair Gray, in Scotland to acquire the rights. "He was a very lovely man," Lanthimos shared, "Unfortunately, he died just a couple of years before we actually made the film, but he was very special and energetic; he was 80-something [when we met], and as soon as I got there, he had seen Dogtooth and said, 'I had my friend put on the DVD, because I don’t know how to operate these things, but I think you're very talented, young man.'" Lanthimos shared that Gray took him on a personal tour of Glasgow, where Gray showed Lanthimos several places that he had incorporated into the story.[citation needed]
				While filming The Favourite (2018), Lanthimos revisited the project, which he discussed with Emma Stone, who also starred in the film. Lanthimos began developing Poor Things more actively following the success of The Favourite: “After the relative success of The Favourite, where I actually made a slightly more expensive film that was successful, people were more inclined to allow me to do whatever it is that I wanted, so I just went back to Gray’s book and said, ‘This is what I want to do.’ It was a long process, but the book was always on my mind.” While developing the film, Lanthimos and Stone collaborated with each other on the short film Bleat (2022).[8]
				Pre-production
				Poor Things was officially announced in February 2021.[9] Lanthimos felt that working with Stone again gave him an advantage to the production, as they developed a mutual trust towards one another. Stone also discussed how the process of making Poor Things was different in comparison to The Favourite, due to also acting as a producer: “It was so interesting to be involved in how the film was being pieced together, from cast to department heads to what have you. Ultimately, Yorgos was the one making those decisions, but I was very involved in the process, which started during the pandemic; we were reaching out to people and casting and everything during that time, because we couldn’t go anywhere.”[10]

				Premise
				A young woman, Bella, is brought back to life by her guardian, the scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter. Initially naïve, Bella is eager to learn about the world around her, albeit under Baxter's protection. Wanting to see more, she runs off with Duncan Wedderburn, a slick and debauched lawyer, and travels across continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella demands equality and liberation.[7]
				Development
				Lanthimos read Poor Things years prior to developing the film and met with the author, Alasdair Gray, in Scotland to acquire the rights. "He was a very lovely man," Lanthimos shared, "Unfortunately, he died just a couple of years before we actually made the film, but he was very special and energetic; he was 80-something [when we met], and as soon as I got there, he had seen Dogtooth and said, 'I had my friend put on the DVD, because I don’t know how to operate these things, but I think you're very talented, young man.'" Lanthimos shared that Gray took him on a personal tour of Glasgow, where Gray showed Lanthimos several places that he had incorporated into the story.[citation needed]
				While filming The Favourite (2018), Lanthimos revisited the project, which he discussed with Emma Stone, who also starred in the film. Lanthimos began developing Poor Things more actively following the success of The Favourite: “After the relative success of The Favourite, where I actually made a slightly more expensive film that was successful, people were more inclined to allow me to do whatever it is that I wanted, so I just went back to Gray’s book and said, ‘This is what I want to do.’ It was a long process, but the book was always on my mind.” While developing the film, Lanthimos and Stone collaborated with each other on the short film Bleat (2022).[8]
				Pre-production
				Poor Things was officially announced in February 2021.[9] Lanthimos felt that working with Stone again gave him an advantage to the production, as they developed a mutual trust towards one another. Stone also discussed how the process of making Poor Things was different in comparison to The Favourite, due to also acting as a producer: “It was so interesting to be involved in how the film was being pieced together, from cast to department heads to what have you. Ultimately, Yorgos was the one making those decisions, but I was very involved in the process, which started during the pandemic; we were reaching out to people and casting and everything during that time, because we couldn’t go anywhere.”[10]

				A young woman, Bella, is brought back to life by her guardian, the scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter. Initially naïve, Bella is eager to learn about the world around her, albeit under Baxter's protection. Wanting to see more, she runs off with Duncan Wedderburn, a slick and debauched lawyer, and travels across continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella demands equality and liberation.[7]
				Development
				Lanthimos read Poor Things years prior to developing the film and met with the author, Alasdair Gray, in Scotland to acquire the rights. "He was a very lovely man," Lanthimos shared, "Unfortunately, he died just a couple of years before we actually made the film, but he was very special and energetic; he was 80-something [when we met], and as soon as I got there, he had seen Dogtooth and said, 'I had my friend put on the DVD, because I don’t know how to operate these things, but I think you're very talented, young man.'" Lanthimos shared that Gray took him on a personal tour of Glasgow, where Gray showed Lanthimos several places that he had incorporated into the story.[citation needed]
				While filming The Favourite (2018), Lanthimos revisited the project, which he discussed with Emma Stone, who also starred in the film. Lanthimos began developing Poor Things more actively following the success of The Favourite: “After the relative success of The Favourite, where I actually made a slightly more expensive film that was successful, people were more inclined to allow me to do whatever it is that I wanted, so I just went back to Gray’s book and said, ‘This is what I want to do.’ It was a long process, but the book was always on my mind.” While developing the film, Lanthimos and Stone collaborated with each other on the short film Bleat (2022).[8]
				Pre-production
				Poor Things was officially announced in February 2021.[9] Lanthimos felt that working with Stone again gave him an advantage to the production, as they developed a mutual trust towards one another. Stone also discussed how the process of making Poor Things was different in comparison to The Favourite, due to also acting as a producer: “It was so interesting to be involved in how the film was being pieced together, from cast to department heads to what have you. Ultimately, Yorgos was the one making those decisions, but I was very involved in the process, which started during the pandemic; we were reaching out to people and casting and everything during that time, because we couldn’t go anywhere.”[10]

				Premise
				A young woman, Bella, is brought back to life by her guardian, the scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter. Initially naïve, Bella is eager to learn about the world around her, albeit under Baxter's protection. Wanting to see more, she runs off with Duncan Wedderburn, a slick and debauched lawyer, and travels across continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella demands equality and liberation.[7]
				Development
				Lanthimos read Poor Things years prior to developing the film and met with the author, Alasdair Gray, in Scotland to acquire the rights. "He was a very lovely man," Lanthimos shared, "Unfortunately, he died just a couple of years before we actually made the film, but he was very special and energetic; he was 80-something [when we met], and as soon as I got there, he had seen Dogtooth and said, 'I had my friend put on the DVD, because I don’t know how to operate these things, but I think you're very talented, young man.'" Lanthimos shared that Gray took him on a personal tour of Glasgow, where Gray showed Lanthimos several places that he had incorporated into the story.[citation needed]
				While filming The Favourite (2018), Lanthimos revisited the project, which he discussed with Emma Stone, who also starred in the film. Lanthimos began developing Poor Things more actively following the success of The Favourite: “After the relative success of The Favourite, where I actually made a slightly more expensive film that was successful, people were more inclined to allow me to do whatever it is that I wanted, so I just went back to Gray’s book and said, ‘This is what I want to do.’ It was a long process, but the book was always on my mind.” While developing the film, Lanthimos and Stone collaborated with each other on the short film Bleat (2022).[8]
				Pre-production
				Poor Things was officially announced in February 2021.[9] Lanthimos felt that working with Stone again gave him an advantage to the production, as they developed a mutual trust towards one another. Stone also discussed how the process of making Poor Things was different in comparison to The Favourite, due to also acting as a producer: “It was so interesting to be involved in how the film was being pieced together, from cast to department heads to what have you. Ultimately, Yorgos was the one making those decisions, but I was very involved in the process, which started during the pandemic; we were reaching out to people and casting and everything during that time, because we couldn’t go anywhere.”[10]

Lanthimos began developing Poor Things more actively following the success of The Favourite: “After the relative success of The Favourite, where I actually made a slightly more expensive film that was successful, people were more inclined to allow me to do whatever it is that I wanted, so I just went back to Gray’s book and said, ‘This is what I want to do.’ It was a long process, but the book was always on my mind.” While developing the film, Lanthimos and Stone collaborated with each other on the short film Bleat (2022).[8]
				Pre-production
				Poor Things was officially announced in February 2021.[9] Lanthimos felt that working with Stone again gave him an advantage to the production, as they developed a mutual trust towards one another. Stone also discussed how the process of making Poor Things was different in comparison to The Favourite, due to also acting as a producer: “It was so interesting to be involved in how the film was being pieced together, from cast to department heads to what have you. Ultimately, Yorgos was the one making those decisions, but I was very involved in the process, which started during the pandemic; we were reaching out to people and casting and everything during that time, because we couldn’t go anywhere.”[10]

				Premise
				A young woman, Bella, is brought back to life by her guardian, the scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter. Initially naïve, Bella is eager to learn about the world around her, albeit under Baxter's protection. Wanting to see more, she runs off with Duncan Wedderburn, a slick and debauched lawyer, and travels across continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella demands equality and liberation.[7]

"He was a very lovely man," Lanthimos shared, "Unfortunately, he died just a couple of years before we actually made the film, but he was very special and energetic; he was 80-something [when we met], and as soon as I got there, he had seen Dogtooth and said, 'I had my friend put on the DVD, because I don’t know how to operate these things, but I think you're very talented, young man.'"

				Premise
				A young woman, Bella, is brought back to life by her guardian, the scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter. Initially naïve, Bella is eager to learn about the world around her, albeit under Baxter's protection. Wanting to see more, she runs off with Duncan Wedderburn, a slick and debauched lawyer, and travels across continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella demands equality and liberation.[7]
				Development
				Lanthimos read Poor Things years prior to developing the film and met with the author, Alasdair Gray, in Scotland to acquire the rights. "He was a very lovely man," Lanthimos shared, "Unfortunately, he died just a couple of years before we actually made the film, but he was very special and energetic; he was 80-something [when we met], and as soon as I got there, he had seen Dogtooth and said, 'I had my friend put on the DVD, because I don’t know how to operate these things, but I think you're very talented, young man.'" Lanthimos shared that Gray took him on a personal tour of Glasgow, where Gray showed Lanthimos several places that he had incorporated into the story.[citation needed]
				While filming The Favourite (2018), Lanthimos revisited the project, which he discussed with Emma Stone, who also starred in the film. Lanthimos began developing Poor Things more actively following the success of The Favourite: “After the relative success of The Favourite, where I actually made a slightly more expensive film that was successful, people were more inclined to allow me to do whatever it is that I wanted, so I just went back to Gray’s book and said, ‘This is what I want to do.’ It was a long process, but the book was always on my mind.” While developing the film, Lanthimos and Stone collaborated with each other on the short film Bleat (2022).[8]
				Pre-production
				Poor Things was officially announced in February 2021.[9] Lanthimos felt that working with Stone again gave him an advantage to the production, as they developed a mutual trust towards one another. Stone also discussed how the process of making Poor Things was different in comparison to The Favourite, due to also acting as a producer: “It was so interesting to be involved in how the film was being pieced together, from cast to department heads to what have you. Ultimately, Yorgos was the one making those decisions, but I was very involved in the process, which started during the pandemic; we were reaching out to people and casting and everything during that time, because we couldn’t go anywhere.”[10]

Ultimately, Yorgos was the one making those decisions, but I was very involved in the process, which started during the pandemic; we were reaching out to people and casting and everything during that time, because we couldn’t go anywhere.”[10]

				Premise
				A young woman, Bella, is brought back to life by her guardian, the scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter. Initially naïve, Bella is eager to learn about the world around her, albeit under Baxter's protection. Wanting to see more, she runs off with Duncan Wedderburn, a slick and debauched lawyer, and travels across continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella demands equality and liberation.[7]
				Development
				Lanthimos read Poor Things years prior to developing the film and met with the author, Alasdair Gray, in Scotland to acquire the rights. "He was a very lovely man," Lanthimos shared, "Unfortunately, he died just a couple of years before we actually made the film, but he was very special and energetic; he was 80-something [when we met], and as soon as I got there, he had seen Dogtooth and said, 'I had my friend put on the DVD, because I don’t know how to operate these things, but I think you're very talented, young man.'" Lanthimos shared that Gray took him on a personal tour of Glasgow, where Gray showed Lanthimos several places that he had incorporated into the story.[citation needed]
				While filming The Favourite (2018), Lanthimos revisited the project, which he discussed with Emma Stone, who also starred in the film. Lanthimos began developing Poor Things more actively following the success of The Favourite: “After the relative success of The Favourite, where I actually made a slightly more expensive film that was successful, people were more inclined to allow me to do whatever it is that I wanted, so I just went back to Gray’s book and said, ‘This is what I want to do.’ It was a long process, but the book was always on my mind.” While developing the film, Lanthimos and Stone collaborated with each other on the short film Bleat (2022).[8]

			<cbc:Description languageID="ENG">
				Premise
				A young woman, Bella, is brought back to life by her guardian, the scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter. Initially naïve, Bella is eager to learn about the world around her, albeit under Baxter's protection. Wanting to see more, she runs off with Duncan Wedderburn, a slick and debauched lawyer, and travels across continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella demands equality and liberation.[7]
				Development
				Lanthimos read Poor Things years prior to developing the film and met with the author, Alasdair Gray, in Scotland to acquire the rights. "He was a very lovely man," Lanthimos shared, "Unfortunately, he died just a couple of years before we actually made the film, but he was very special and energetic; he was 80-something [when we met], and as soon as I got there, he had seen Dogtooth and said, 'I had my friend put on the DVD, because I don’t know how to operate these things, but I think you're very talented, young man.'" Lanthimos shared that Gray took him on a personal tour of Glasgow, where Gray showed Lanthimos several places that he had incorporated into the story.[citation needed]
				While filming The Favourite (2018), Lanthimos revisited the project, which he discussed with Emma Stone, who also starred in the film. Lanthimos began developing Poor Things more actively following the success of The Favourite: “After the relative success of The Favourite, where I actually made a slightly more expensive film that was successful, people were more inclined to allow me to do whatever it is that I wanted, so I just went back to Gray’s book and said, ‘This is what I want to do.’ It was a long process, but the book was always on my mind.” While developing the film, Lanthimos and Stone collaborated with each other on the short film Bleat (2022).[8]
				Pre-production
				Poor Things was officially announced in February 2021.[9] Lanthimos felt that working with Stone again gave him an advantage to the production, as they developed a mutual trust towards one another. Stone also discussed how the process of making Poor Things was different in comparison to The Favourite, due to also acting as a producer: “It was so interesting to be involved in how the film was being pieced together, from cast to department heads to what have you. Ultimately, Yorgos was the one making those decisions, but I was very involved in the process, which started during the pandemic; we were reaching out to people and casting and everything during that time, because we couldn’t go anywhere.”[10]

				Premise
				A young woman, Bella, is brought back to life by her guardian, the scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter. Initially naïve, Bella is eager to learn about the world around her, albeit under Baxter's protection. Wanting to see more, she runs off with Duncan Wedderburn, a slick and debauched lawyer, and travels across continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella demands equality and liberation.[7]
				Development
				Lanthimos read Poor Things years prior to developing the film and met with the author, Alasdair Gray, in Scotland to acquire the rights. "He was a very lovely man," Lanthimos shared, "Unfortunately, he died just a couple of years before we actually made the film, but he was very special and energetic; he was 80-something [when we met], and as soon as I got there, he had seen Dogtooth and said, 'I had my friend put on the DVD, because I don’t know how to operate these things, but I think you're very talented, young man.'" Lanthimos shared that Gray took him on a personal tour of Glasgow, where Gray showed Lanthimos several places that he had incorporated into the story.[citation needed]
				While filming The Favourite (2018), Lanthimos revisited the project, which he discussed with Emma Stone, who also starred in the film. Lanthimos began developing Poor Things more actively following the success of The Favourite: “After the relative success of The Favourite, where I actually made a slightly more expensive film that was successful, people were more inclined to allow me to do whatever it is that I wanted, so I just went back to Gray’s book and said, ‘This is what I want to do.’ It was a long process, but the book was always on my mind.” While developing the film, Lanthimos and Stone collaborated with each other on the short film Bleat (2022).[8]
				Pre-production
				Poor Things was officially announced in February 2021.[9] Lanthimos felt that working with Stone again gave him an advantage to the production, as they developed a mutual trust towards one another. Stone also discussed how the process of making Poor Things was different in comparison to The Favourite, due to also acting as a producer: “It was so interesting to be involved in how the film was being pieced together, from cast to department heads to what have you. Ultimately, Yorgos was the one making those decisions, but I was very involved in the process, which started during the pandemic; we were reaching out to people and casting and everything during that time, because we couldn’t go anywhere.”[10]

				A young woman, Bella, is brought back to life by her guardian, the scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter. Initially naïve, Bella is eager to learn about the world around her, albeit under Baxter's protection. Wanting to see more, she runs off with Duncan Wedderburn, a slick and debauched lawyer, and travels across continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella demands equality and liberation.[7]
				Development
				Lanthimos read Poor Things years prior to developing the film and met with the author, Alasdair Gray, in Scotland to acquire the rights. "He was a very lovely man," Lanthimos shared, "Unfortunately, he died just a couple of years before we actually made the film, but he was very special and energetic; he was 80-something [when we met], and as soon as I got there, he had seen Dogtooth and said, 'I had my friend put on the DVD, because I don’t know how to operate these things, but I think you're very talented, young man.'" Lanthimos shared that Gray took him on a personal tour of Glasgow, where Gray showed Lanthimos several places that he had incorporated into the story.[citation needed]
				While filming The Favourite (2018), Lanthimos revisited the project, which he discussed with Emma Stone, who also starred in the film. Lanthimos began developing Poor Things more actively following the success of The Favourite: “After the relative success of The Favourite, where I actually made a slightly more expensive film that was successful, people were more inclined to allow me to do whatever it is that I wanted, so I just went back to Gray’s book and said, ‘This is what I want to do.’ It was a long process, but the book was always on my mind.” While developing the film, Lanthimos and Stone collaborated with each other on the short film Bleat (2022).[8]
				Pre-production
				Poor Things was officially announced in February 2021.[9] Lanthimos felt that working with Stone again gave him an advantage to the production, as they developed a mutual trust towards one another. Stone also discussed how the process of making Poor Things was different in comparison to The Favourite, due to also acting as a producer: “It was so interesting to be involved in how the film was being pieced together, from cast to department heads to what have you. Ultimately, Yorgos was the one making those decisions, but I was very involved in the process, which started during the pandemic; we were reaching out to people and casting and everything during that time, because we couldn’t go anywhere.”[10]

				Premise
				A young woman, Bella, is brought back to life by her guardian, the scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter. Initially naïve, Bella is eager to learn about the world around her, albeit under Baxter's protection. Wanting to see more, she runs off with Duncan Wedderburn, a slick and debauched lawyer, and travels across continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella demands equality and liberation.[7]
				Development
				Lanthimos read Poor Things years prior to developing the film and met with the author, Alasdair Gray, in Scotland to acquire the rights. "He was a very lovely man," Lanthimos shared, "Unfortunately, he died just a couple of years before we actually made the film, but he was very special and energetic; he was 80-something [when we met], and as soon as I got there, he had seen Dogtooth and said, 'I had my friend put on the DVD, because I don’t know how to operate these things, but I think you're very talented, young man.'" Lanthimos shared that Gray took him on a personal tour of Glasgow, where Gray showed Lanthimos several places that he had incorporated into the story.[citation needed]
				While filming The Favourite (2018), Lanthimos revisited the project, which he discussed with Emma Stone, who also starred in the film. Lanthimos began developing Poor Things more actively following the success of The Favourite: “After the relative success of The Favourite, where I actually made a slightly more expensive film that was successful, people were more inclined to allow me to do whatever it is that I wanted, so I just went back to Gray’s book and said, ‘This is what I want to do.’ It was a long process, but the book was always on my mind.” While developing the film, Lanthimos and Stone collaborated with each other on the short film Bleat (2022).[8]
				Pre-production
				Poor Things was officially announced in February 2021.[9] Lanthimos felt that working with Stone again gave him an advantage to the production, as they developed a mutual trust towards one another. Stone also discussed how the process of making Poor Things was different in comparison to The Favourite, due to also acting as a producer: “It was so interesting to be involved in how the film was being pieced together, from cast to department heads to what have you. Ultimately, Yorgos was the one making those decisions, but I was very involved in the process, which started during the pandemic; we were reaching out to people and casting and everything during that time, because we couldn’t go anywhere.”[10]

Lanthimos began developing Poor Things more actively following the success of The Favourite: “After the relative success of The Favourite, where I actually made a slightly more expensive film that was successful, people were more inclined to allow me to do whatever it is that I wanted, so I just went back to Gray’s book and said, ‘This is what I want to do.’ It was a long process, but the book was always on my mind.” While developing the film, Lanthimos and Stone collaborated with each other on the short film Bleat (2022).[8]
				Pre-production
				Poor Things was officially announced in February 2021.[9] Lanthimos felt that working with Stone again gave him an advantage to the production, as they developed a mutual trust towards one another. Stone also discussed how the process of making Poor Things was different in comparison to The Favourite, due to also acting as a producer: “It was so interesting to be involved in how the film was being pieced together, from cast to department heads to what have you. Ultimately, Yorgos was the one making those decisions, but I was very involved in the process, which started during the pandemic; we were reaching out to people and casting and everything during that time, because we couldn’t go anywhere.”[10]

				Premise
				A young woman, Bella, is brought back to life by her guardian, the scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter. Initially naïve, Bella is eager to learn about the world around her, albeit under Baxter's protection. Wanting to see more, she runs off with Duncan Wedderburn, a slick and debauched lawyer, and travels across continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella demands equality and liberation.[7]

"He was a very lovely man," Lanthimos shared, "Unfortunately, he died just a couple of years before we actually made the film, but he was very special and energetic; he was 80-something [when we met], and as soon as I got there, he had seen Dogtooth and said, 'I had my friend put on the DVD, because I don’t know how to operate these things, but I think you're very talented, young man.'"

				Premise
				A young woman, Bella, is brought back to life by her guardian, the scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter. Initially naïve, Bella is eager to learn about the world around her, albeit under Baxter's protection. Wanting to see more, she runs off with Duncan Wedderburn, a slick and debauched lawyer, and travels across continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella demands equality and liberation.[7]
				Development
				Lanthimos read Poor Things years prior to developing the film and met with the author, Alasdair Gray, in Scotland to acquire the rights. "He was a very lovely man," Lanthimos shared, "Unfortunately, he died just a couple of years before we actually made the film, but he was very special and energetic; he was 80-something [when we met], and as soon as I got there, he had seen Dogtooth and said, 'I had my friend put on the DVD, because I don’t know how to operate these things, but I think you're very talented, young man.'" Lanthimos shared that Gray took him on a personal tour of Glasgow, where Gray showed Lanthimos several places that he had incorporated into the story.[citation needed]
				While filming The Favourite (2018), Lanthimos revisited the project, which he discussed with Emma Stone, who also starred in the film. Lanthimos began developing Poor Things more actively following the success of The Favourite: “After the relative success of The Favourite, where I actually made a slightly more expensive film that was successful, people were more inclined to allow me to do whatever it is that I wanted, so I just went back to Gray’s book and said, ‘This is what I want to do.’ It was a long process, but the book was always on my mind.” While developing the film, Lanthimos and Stone collaborated with each other on the short film Bleat (2022).[8]
				Pre-production
				Poor Things was officially announced in February 2021.[9] Lanthimos felt that working with Stone again gave him an advantage to the production, as they developed a mutual trust towards one another. Stone also discussed how the process of making Poor Things was different in comparison to The Favourite, due to also acting as a producer: “It was so interesting to be involved in how the film was being pieced together, from cast to department heads to what have you. Ultimately, Yorgos was the one making those decisions, but I was very involved in the process, which started during the pandemic; we were reaching out to people and casting and everything during that time, because we couldn’t go anywhere.”[10]

Ultimately, Yorgos was the one making those decisions, but I was very involved in the process, which started during the pandemic; we were reaching out to people and casting and everything during that time, because we couldn’t go anywhere.”[10]

				Premise
				A young woman, Bella, is brought back to life by her guardian, the scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter. Initially naïve, Bella is eager to learn about the world around her, albeit under Baxter's protection. Wanting to see more, she runs off with Duncan Wedderburn, a slick and debauched lawyer, and travels across continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella demands equality and liberation.[7]
				Development
				Lanthimos read Poor Things years prior to developing the film and met with the author, Alasdair Gray, in Scotland to acquire the rights. "He was a very lovely man," Lanthimos shared, "Unfortunately, he died just a couple of years before we actually made the film, but he was very special and energetic; he was 80-something [when we met], and as soon as I got there, he had seen Dogtooth and said, 'I had my friend put on the DVD, because I don’t know how to operate these things, but I think you're very talented, young man.'" Lanthimos shared that Gray took him on a personal tour of Glasgow, where Gray showed Lanthimos several places that he had incorporated into the story.[citation needed]
				While filming The Favourite (2018), Lanthimos revisited the project, which he discussed with Emma Stone, who also starred in the film. Lanthimos began developing Poor Things more actively following the success of The Favourite: “After the relative success of The Favourite, where I actually made a slightly more expensive film that was successful, people were more inclined to allow me to do whatever it is that I wanted, so I just went back to Gray’s book and said, ‘This is what I want to do.’ It was a long process, but the book was always on my mind.” While developing the film, Lanthimos and Stone collaborated with each other on the short film Bleat (2022).[8]

			<cbc:Description languageID="ENG">
				Premise
				A young woman, Bella, is brought back to life by her guardian, the scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter. Initially naïve, Bella is eager to learn about the world around her, albeit under Baxter's protection. Wanting to see more, she runs off with Duncan Wedderburn, a slick and debauched lawyer, and travels across continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella demands equality and liberation.[7]
				Development
				Lanthimos read Poor Things years prior to developing the film and met with the author, Alasdair Gray, in Scotland to acquire the rights. "He was a very lovely man," Lanthimos shared, "Unfortunately, he died just a couple of years before we actually made the film, but he was very special and energetic; he was 80-something [when we met], and as soon as I got there, he had seen Dogtooth and said, 'I had my friend put on the DVD, because I don’t know how to operate these things, but I think you're very talented, young man.'" Lanthimos shared that Gray took him on a personal tour of Glasgow, where Gray showed Lanthimos several places that he had incorporated into the story.[citation needed]
				While filming The Favourite (2018), Lanthimos revisited the project, which he discussed with Emma Stone, who also starred in the film. Lanthimos began developing Poor Things more actively following the success of The Favourite: “After the relative success of The Favourite, where I actually made a slightly more expensive film that was successful, people were more inclined to allow me to do whatever it is that I wanted, so I just went back to Gray’s book and said, ‘This is what I want to do.’ It was a long process, but the book was always on my mind.” While developing the film, Lanthimos and Stone collaborated with each other on the short film Bleat (2022).[8]
				Pre-production
				Poor Things was officially announced in February 2021.[9] Lanthimos felt that working with Stone again gave him an advantage to the production, as they developed a mutual trust towards one another. Stone also discussed how the process of making Poor Things was different in comparison to The Favourite, due to also acting as a producer: “It was so interesting to be involved in how the film was being pieced together, from cast to department heads to what have you. Ultimately, Yorgos was the one making those decisions, but I was very involved in the process, which started during the pandemic; we were reaching out to people and casting and everything during that time, because we couldn’t go anywhere.”[10]

				Premise
				A young woman, Bella, is brought back to life by her guardian, the scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter. Initially naïve, Bella is eager to learn about the world around her, albeit under Baxter's protection. Wanting to see more, she runs off with Duncan Wedderburn, a slick and debauched lawyer, and travels across continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella demands equality and liberation.[7]
				Development
				Lanthimos read Poor Things years prior to developing the film and met with the author, Alasdair Gray, in Scotland to acquire the rights. "He was a very lovely man," Lanthimos shared, "Unfortunately, he died just a couple of years before we actually made the film, but he was very special and energetic; he was 80-something [when we met], and as soon as I got there, he had seen Dogtooth and said, 'I had my friend put on the DVD, because I don’t know how to operate these things, but I think you're very talented, young man.'" Lanthimos shared that Gray took him on a personal tour of Glasgow, where Gray showed Lanthimos several places that he had incorporated into the story.[citation needed]
				While filming The Favourite (2018), Lanthimos revisited the project, which he discussed with Emma Stone, who also starred in the film. Lanthimos began developing Poor Things more actively following the success of The Favourite: “After the relative success of The Favourite, where I actually made a slightly more expensive film that was successful, people were more inclined to allow me to do whatever it is that I wanted, so I just went back to Gray’s book and said, ‘This is what I want to do.’ It was a long process, but the book was always on my mind.” While developing the film, Lanthimos and Stone collaborated with each other on the short film Bleat (2022).[8]
				Pre-production
				Poor Things was officially announced in February 2021.[9] Lanthimos felt that working with Stone again gave him an advantage to the production, as they developed a mutual trust towards one another. Stone also discussed how the process of making Poor Things was different in comparison to The Favourite, due to also acting as a producer: “It was so interesting to be involved in how the film was being pieced together, from cast to department heads to what have you. Ultimately, Yorgos was the one making those decisions, but I was very involved in the process, which started during the pandemic; we were reaching out to people and casting and everything during that time, because we couldn’t go anywhere.”[10]

				A young woman, Bella, is brought back to life by her guardian, the scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter. Initially naïve, Bella is eager to learn about the world around her, albeit under Baxter's protection. Wanting to see more, she runs off with Duncan Wedderburn, a slick and debauched lawyer, and travels across continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella demands equality and liberation.[7]
				Development
				Lanthimos read Poor Things years prior to developing the film and met with the author, Alasdair Gray, in Scotland to acquire the rights. "He was a very lovely man," Lanthimos shared, "Unfortunately, he died just a couple of years before we actually made the film, but he was very special and energetic; he was 80-something [when we met], and as soon as I got there, he had seen Dogtooth and said, 'I had my friend put on the DVD, because I don’t know how to operate these things, but I think you're very talented, young man.'" Lanthimos shared that Gray took him on a personal tour of Glasgow, where Gray showed Lanthimos several places that he had incorporated into the story.[citation needed]
				While filming The Favourite (2018), Lanthimos revisited the project, which he discussed with Emma Stone, who also starred in the film. Lanthimos began developing Poor Things more actively following the success of The Favourite: “After the relative success of The Favourite, where I actually made a slightly more expensive film that was successful, people were more inclined to allow me to do whatever it is that I wanted, so I just went back to Gray’s book and said, ‘This is what I want to do.’ It was a long process, but the book was always on my mind.” While developing the film, Lanthimos and Stone collaborated with each other on the short film Bleat (2022).[8]
				Pre-production
				Poor Things was officially announced in February 2021.[9] Lanthimos felt that working with Stone again gave him an advantage to the production, as they developed a mutual trust towards one another. Stone also discussed how the process of making Poor Things was different in comparison to The Favourite, due to also acting as a producer: “It was so interesting to be involved in how the film was being pieced together, from cast to department heads to what have you. Ultimately, Yorgos was the one making those decisions, but I was very involved in the process, which started during the pandemic; we were reaching out to people and casting and everything during that time, because we couldn’t go anywhere.”[10]

				Premise
				A young woman, Bella, is brought back to life by her guardian, the scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter. Initially naïve, Bella is eager to learn about the world around her, albeit under Baxter's protection. Wanting to see more, she runs off with Duncan Wedderburn, a slick and debauched lawyer, and travels across continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella demands equality and liberation.[7]
				Development
				Lanthimos read Poor Things years prior to developing the film and met with the author, Alasdair Gray, in Scotland to acquire the rights. "He was a very lovely man," Lanthimos shared, "Unfortunately, he died just a couple of years before we actually made the film, but he was very special and energetic; he was 80-something [when we met], and as soon as I got there, he had seen Dogtooth and said, 'I had my friend put on the DVD, because I don’t know how to operate these things, but I think you're very talented, young man.'" Lanthimos shared that Gray took him on a personal tour of Glasgow, where Gray showed Lanthimos several places that he had incorporated into the story.[citation needed]
				While filming The Favourite (2018), Lanthimos revisited the project, which he discussed with Emma Stone, who also starred in the film. Lanthimos began developing Poor Things more actively following the success of The Favourite: “After the relative success of The Favourite, where I actually made a slightly more expensive film that was successful, people were more inclined to allow me to do whatever it is that I wanted, so I just went back to Gray’s book and said, ‘This is what I want to do.’ It was a long process, but the book was always on my mind.” While developing the film, Lanthimos and Stone collaborated with each other on the short film Bleat (2022).[8]
				Pre-production
				Poor Things was officially announced in February 2021.[9] Lanthimos felt that working with Stone again gave him an advantage to the production, as they developed a mutual trust towards one another. Stone also discussed how the process of making Poor Things was different in comparison to The Favourite, due to also acting as a producer: “It was so interesting to be involved in how the film was being pieced together, from cast to department heads to what have you. Ultimately, Yorgos was the one making those decisions, but I was very involved in the process, which started during the pandemic; we were reaching out to people and casting and everything during that time, because we couldn’t go anywhere.”[10]

Lanthimos began developing Poor Things more actively following the success of The Favourite: “After the relative success of The Favourite, where I actually made a slightly more expensive film that was successful, people were more inclined to allow me to do whatever it is that I wanted, so I just went back to Gray’s book and said, ‘This is what I want to do.’ It was a long process, but the book was always on my mind.” While developing the film, Lanthimos and Stone collaborated with each other on the short film Bleat (2022).[8]
				Pre-production
				Poor Things was officially announced in February 2021.[9] Lanthimos felt that working with Stone again gave him an advantage to the production, as they developed a mutual trust towards one another. Stone also discussed how the process of making Poor Things was different in comparison to The Favourite, due to also acting as a producer: “It was so interesting to be involved in how the film was being pieced together, from cast to department heads to what have you. Ultimately, Yorgos was the one making those decisions, but I was very involved in the process, which started during the pandemic; we were reaching out to people and casting and everything during that time, because we couldn’t go anywhere.”[10]

				Premise
				A young woman, Bella, is brought back to life by her guardian, the scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter. Initially naïve, Bella is eager to learn about the world around her, albeit under Baxter's protection. Wanting to see more, she runs off with Duncan Wedderburn, a slick and debauched lawyer, and travels across continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella demands equality and liberation.[7]

"He was a very lovely man," Lanthimos shared, "Unfortunately, he died just a couple of years before we actually made the film, but he was very special and energetic; he was 80-something [when we met], and as soon as I got there, he had seen Dogtooth and said, 'I had my friend put on the DVD, because I don’t know how to operate these things, but I think you're very talented, young man.'"

				Premise
				A young woman, Bella, is brought back to life by her guardian, the scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter. Initially naïve, Bella is eager to learn about the world around her, albeit under Baxter's protection. Wanting to see more, she runs off with Duncan Wedderburn, a slick and debauched lawyer, and travels across continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella demands equality and liberation.[7]
				Development
				Lanthimos read Poor Things years prior to developing the film and met with the author, Alasdair Gray, in Scotland to acquire the rights. "He was a very lovely man," Lanthimos shared, "Unfortunately, he died just a couple of years before we actually made the film, but he was very special and energetic; he was 80-something [when we met], and as soon as I got there, he had seen Dogtooth and said, 'I had my friend put on the DVD, because I don’t know how to operate these things, but I think you're very talented, young man.'" Lanthimos shared that Gray took him on a personal tour of Glasgow, where Gray showed Lanthimos several places that he had incorporated into the story.[citation needed]
				While filming The Favourite (2018), Lanthimos revisited the project, which he discussed with Emma Stone, who also starred in the film. Lanthimos began developing Poor Things more actively following the success of The Favourite: “After the relative success of The Favourite, where I actually made a slightly more expensive film that was successful, people were more inclined to allow me to do whatever it is that I wanted, so I just went back to Gray’s book and said, ‘This is what I want to do.’ It was a long process, but the book was always on my mind.” While developing the film, Lanthimos and Stone collaborated with each other on the short film Bleat (2022).[8]
				Pre-production
				Poor Things was officially announced in February 2021.[9] Lanthimos felt that working with Stone again gave him an advantage to the production, as they developed a mutual trust towards one another. Stone also discussed how the process of making Poor Things was different in comparison to The Favourite, due to also acting as a producer: “It was so interesting to be involved in how the film was being pieced together, from cast to department heads to what have you. Ultimately, Yorgos was the one making those decisions, but I was very involved in the process, which started during the pandemic; we were reaching out to people and casting and everything during that time, because we couldn’t go anywhere.”[10]

Ultimately, Yorgos was the one making those decisions, but I was very involved in the process, which started during the pandemic; we were reaching out to people and casting and everything during that time, because we couldn’t go anywhere.”[10]

				Premise
				A young woman, Bella, is brought back to life by her guardian, the scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter. Initially naïve, Bella is eager to learn about the world around her, albeit under Baxter's protection. Wanting to see more, she runs off with Duncan Wedderburn, a slick and debauched lawyer, and travels across continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella demands equality and liberation.[7]
				Development
				Lanthimos read Poor Things years prior to developing the film and met with the author, Alasdair Gray, in Scotland to acquire the rights. "He was a very lovely man," Lanthimos shared, "Unfortunately, he died just a couple of years before we actually made the film, but he was very special and energetic; he was 80-something [when we met], and as soon as I got there, he had seen Dogtooth and said, 'I had my friend put on the DVD, because I don’t know how to operate these things, but I think you're very talented, young man.'" Lanthimos shared that Gray took him on a personal tour of Glasgow, where Gray showed Lanthimos several places that he had incorporated into the story.[citation needed]
				While filming The Favourite (2018), Lanthimos revisited the project, which he discussed with Emma Stone, who also starred in the film. Lanthimos began developing Poor Things more actively following the success of The Favourite: “After the relative success of The Favourite, where I actually made a slightly more expensive film that was successful, people were more inclined to allow me to do whatever it is that I wanted, so I just went back to Gray’s book and said, ‘This is what I want to do.’ It was a long process, but the book was always on my mind.” While developing the film, Lanthimos and Stone collaborated with each other on the short film Bleat (2022).[8]

			<cbc:Description languageID="ENG">
				Premise
				A young woman, Bella, is brought back to life by her guardian, the scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter. Initially naïve, Bella is eager to learn about the world around her, albeit under Baxter's protection. Wanting to see more, she runs off with Duncan Wedderburn, a slick and debauched lawyer, and travels across continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella demands equality and liberation.[7]
				Development
				Lanthimos read Poor Things years prior to developing the film and met with the author, Alasdair Gray, in Scotland to acquire the rights. "He was a very lovely man," Lanthimos shared, "Unfortunately, he died just a couple of years before we actually made the film, but he was very special and energetic; he was 80-something [when we met], and as soon as I got there, he had seen Dogtooth and said, 'I had my friend put on the DVD, because I don’t know how to operate these things, but I think you're very talented, young man.'" Lanthimos shared that Gray took him on a personal tour of Glasgow, where Gray showed Lanthimos several places that he had incorporated into the story.[citation needed]
				While filming The Favourite (2018), Lanthimos revisited the project, which he discussed with Emma Stone, who also starred in the film. Lanthimos began developing Poor Things more actively following the success of The Favourite: “After the relative success of The Favourite, where I actually made a slightly more expensive film that was successful, people were more inclined to allow me to do whatever it is that I wanted, so I just went back to Gray’s book and said, ‘This is what I want to do.’ It was a long process, but the book was always on my mind.” While developing the film, Lanthimos and Stone collaborated with each other on the short film Bleat (2022).[8]
				Pre-production
				Poor Things was officially announced in February 2021.[9] Lanthimos felt that working with Stone again gave him an advantage to the production, as they developed a mutual trust towards one another. Stone also discussed how the process of making Poor Things was different in comparison to The Favourite, due to also acting as a producer: “It was so interesting to be involved in how the film was being pieced together, from cast to department heads to what have you. Ultimately, Yorgos was the one making those decisions, but I was very involved in the process, which started during the pandemic; we were reaching out to people and casting and everything during that time, because we couldn’t go anywhere.”[10]

			<cbc:Description languageID="ENG">
				Premise
				A young woman, Bella, is brought back to life by her guardian, the scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter. Initially naïve, Bella is eager to learn about the world around her, albeit under Baxter's protection. Wanting to see more, she runs off with Duncan Wedderburn, a slick and debauched lawyer, and travels across continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella demands equality and liberation.[7]
				Development
				Lanthimos read Poor Things years prior to developing the film and met with the author, Alasdair Gray, in Scotland to acquire the rights. "He was a very lovely man," Lanthimos shared, "Unfortunately, he died just a couple of years before we actually made the film, but he was very special and energetic; he was 80-something [when we met], and as soon as I got there, he had seen Dogtooth and said, 'I had my friend put on the DVD, because I don’t know how to operate these things, but I think you're very talented, young man.'" Lanthimos shared that Gray took him on a personal tour of Glasgow, where Gray showed Lanthimos several places that he had incorporated into the story.[citation needed]
				While filming The Favourite (2018), Lanthimos revisited the project, which he discussed with Emma Stone, who also starred in the film. Lanthimos began developing Poor Things more actively following the success of The Favourite: “After the relative success of The Favourite, where I actually made a slightly more expensive film that was successful, people were more inclined to allow me to do whatever it is that I wanted, so I just went back to Gray’s book and said, ‘This is what I want to do.’ It was a long process, but the book was always on my mind.” While developing the film, Lanthimos and Stone collaborated with each other on the short film Bleat (2022).[8]
				Pre-production
				Poor Things was officially announced in February 2021.[9] Lanthimos felt that working with Stone again gave him an advantage to the production, as they developed a mutual trust towards one another. Stone also discussed how the process of making Poor Things was different in comparison to The Favourite, due to also acting as a producer: “It was so interesting to be involved in how the film was being pieced together, from cast to department heads to what have you. Ultimately, Yorgos was the one making those decisions, but I was very involved in the process, which started during the pandemic; we were reaching out to people and casting and everything during that time, because we couldn’t go anywhere.”[10]

				A young woman, Bella, is brought back to life by her guardian, the scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter. Initially naïve, Bella is eager to learn about the world around her, albeit under Baxter's protection. Wanting to see more, she runs off with Duncan Wedderburn, a slick and debauched lawyer, and travels across continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella demands equality and liberation.[7]
				Development
				Lanthimos read Poor Things years prior to developing the film and met with the author, Alasdair Gray, in Scotland to acquire the rights. "He was a very lovely man," Lanthimos shared, "Unfortunately, he died just a couple of years before we actually made the film, but he was very special and energetic; he was 80-something [when we met], and as soon as I got there, he had seen Dogtooth and said, 'I had my friend put on the DVD, because I don’t know how to operate these things, but I think you're very talented, young man.'" Lanthimos shared that Gray took him on a personal tour of Glasgow, where Gray showed Lanthimos several places that he had incorporated into the story.[citation needed]
				While filming The Favourite (2018), Lanthimos revisited the project, which he discussed with Emma Stone, who also starred in the film. Lanthimos began developing Poor Things more actively following the success of The Favourite: “After the relative success of The Favourite, where I actually made a slightly more expensive film that was successful, people were more inclined to allow me to do whatever it is that I wanted, so I just went back to Gray’s book and said, ‘This is what I want to do.’ It was a long process, but the book was always on my mind.” While developing the film, Lanthimos and Stone collaborated with each other on the short film Bleat (2022).[8]
				Pre-production
				Poor Things was officially announced in February 2021.[9] Lanthimos felt that working with Stone again gave him an advantage to the production, as they developed a mutual trust towards one another. Stone also discussed how the process of making Poor Things was different in comparison to The Favourite, due to also acting as a producer: “It was so interesting to be involved in how the film was being pieced together, from cast to department heads to what have you. Ultimately, Yorgos was the one making those decisions, but I was very involved in the process, which started during the pandemic; we were reaching out to people and casting and everything during that time, because we couldn’t go anywhere.”[10]

				Premise
				A young woman, Bella, is brought back to life by her guardian, the scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter. Initially naïve, Bella is eager to learn about the world around her, albeit under Baxter's protection. Wanting to see more, she runs off with Duncan Wedderburn, a slick and debauched lawyer, and travels across continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella demands equality and liberation.[7]
				Development
				Lanthimos read Poor Things years prior to developing the film and met with the author, Alasdair Gray, in Scotland to acquire the rights. "He was a very lovely man," Lanthimos shared, "Unfortunately, he died just a couple of years before we actually made the film, but he was very special and energetic; he was 80-something [when we met], and as soon as I got there, he had seen Dogtooth and said, 'I had my friend put on the DVD, because I don’t know how to operate these things, but I think you're very talented, young man.'" Lanthimos shared that Gray took him on a personal tour of Glasgow, where Gray showed Lanthimos several places that he had incorporated into the story.[citation needed]
				While filming The Favourite (2018), Lanthimos revisited the project, which he discussed with Emma Stone, who also starred in the film. Lanthimos began developing Poor Things more actively following the success of The Favourite: “After the relative success of The Favourite, where I actually made a slightly more expensive film that was successful, people were more inclined to allow me to do whatever it is that I wanted, so I just went back to Gray’s book and said, ‘This is what I want to do.’ It was a long process, but the book was always on my mind.” While developing the film, Lanthimos and Stone collaborated with each other on the short film Bleat (2022).[8]
				Pre-production
				Poor Things was officially announced in February 2021.[9] Lanthimos felt that working with Stone again gave him an advantage to the production, as they developed a mutual trust towards one another. Stone also discussed how the process of making Poor Things was different in comparison to The Favourite, due to also acting as a producer: “It was so interesting to be involved in how the film was being pieced together, from cast to department heads to what have you. Ultimately, Yorgos was the one making those decisions, but I was very involved in the process, which started during the pandemic; we were reaching out to people and casting and everything during that time, because we couldn’t go anywhere.”[10]

Lanthimos began developing Poor Things more actively following the success of The Favourite: “After the relative success of The Favourite, where I actually made a slightly more expensive film that was successful, people were more inclined to allow me to do whatever it is that I wanted, so I just went back to Gray’s book and said, ‘This is what I want to do.’ It was a long process, but the book was always on my mind.” While developing the film, Lanthimos and Stone collaborated with each other on the short film Bleat (2022).[8]
				Pre-production
				Poor Things was officially announced in February 2021.[9] Lanthimos felt that working with Stone again gave him an advantage to the production, as they developed a mutual trust towards one another. Stone also discussed how the process of making Poor Things was different in comparison to The Favourite, due to also acting as a producer: “It was so interesting to be involved in how the film was being pieced together, from cast to department heads to what have you. Ultimately, Yorgos was the one making those decisions, but I was very involved in the process, which started during the pandemic; we were reaching out to people and casting and everything during that time, because we couldn’t go anywhere.”[10]

				Premise
				A young woman, Bella, is brought back to life by her guardian, the scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter. Initially naïve, Bella is eager to learn about the world around her, albeit under Baxter's protection. Wanting to see more, she runs off with Duncan Wedderburn, a slick and debauched lawyer, and travels across continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella demands equality and liberation.[7]

"He was a very lovely man," Lanthimos shared, "Unfortunately, he died just a couple of years before we actually made the film, but he was very special and energetic; he was 80-something [when we met], and as soon as I got there, he had seen Dogtooth and said, 'I had my friend put on the DVD, because I don’t know how to operate these things, but I think you're very talented, young man.'"

				Premise
				A young woman, Bella, is brought back to life by her guardian, the scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter. Initially naïve, Bella is eager to learn about the world around her, albeit under Baxter's protection. Wanting to see more, she runs off with Duncan Wedderburn, a slick and debauched lawyer, and travels across continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella demands equality and liberation.[7]
				Development
				Lanthimos read Poor Things years prior to developing the film and met with the author, Alasdair Gray, in Scotland to acquire the rights. "He was a very lovely man," Lanthimos shared, "Unfortunately, he died just a couple of years before we actually made the film, but he was very special and energetic; he was 80-something [when we met], and as soon as I got there, he had seen Dogtooth and said, 'I had my friend put on the DVD, because I don’t know how to operate these things, but I think you're very talented, young man.'" Lanthimos shared that Gray took him on a personal tour of Glasgow, where Gray showed Lanthimos several places that he had incorporated into the story.[citation needed]
				While filming The Favourite (2018), Lanthimos revisited the project, which he discussed with Emma Stone, who also starred in the film. Lanthimos began developing Poor Things more actively following the success of The Favourite: “After the relative success of The Favourite, where I actually made a slightly more expensive film that was successful, people were more inclined to allow me to do whatever it is that I wanted, so I just went back to Gray’s book and said, ‘This is what I want to do.’ It was a long process, but the book was always on my mind.” While developing the film, Lanthimos and Stone collaborated with each other on the short film Bleat (2022).[8]
				Pre-production
				Poor Things was officially announced in February 2021.[9] Lanthimos felt that working with Stone again gave him an advantage to the production, as they developed a mutual trust towards one another. Stone also discussed how the process of making Poor Things was different in comparison to The Favourite, due to also acting as a producer: “It was so interesting to be involved in how the film was being pieced together, from cast to department heads to what have you. Ultimately, Yorgos was the one making those decisions, but I was very involved in the process, which started during the pandemic; we were reaching out to people and casting and everything during that time, because we couldn’t go anywhere.”[10]

Ultimately, Yorgos was the one making those decisions, but I was very involved in the process, which started during the pandemic; we were reaching out to people and casting and everything during that time, because we couldn’t go anywhere.”[10]

				Premise
				A young woman, Bella, is brought back to life by her guardian, the scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter. Initially naïve, Bella is eager to learn about the world around her, albeit under Baxter's protection. Wanting to see more, she runs off with Duncan Wedderburn, a slick and debauched lawyer, and travels across continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella demands equality and liberation.[7]
				Development
				Lanthimos read Poor Things years prior to developing the film and met with the author, Alasdair Gray, in Scotland to acquire the rights. "He was a very lovely man," Lanthimos shared, "Unfortunately, he died just a couple of years before we actually made the film, but he was very special and energetic; he was 80-something [when we met], and as soon as I got there, he had seen Dogtooth and said, 'I had my friend put on the DVD, because I don’t know how to operate these things, but I think you're very talented, young man.'" Lanthimos shared that Gray took him on a personal tour of Glasgow, where Gray showed Lanthimos several places that he had incorporated into the story.[citation needed]
				While filming The Favourite (2018), Lanthimos revisited the project, which he discussed with Emma Stone, who also starred in the film. Lanthimos began developing Poor Things more actively following the success of The Favourite: “After the relative success of The Favourite, where I actually made a slightly more expensive film that was successful, people were more inclined to allow me to do whatever it is that I wanted, so I just went back to Gray’s book and said, ‘This is what I want to do.’ It was a long process, but the book was always on my mind.” While developing the film, Lanthimos and Stone collaborated with each other on the short film Bleat (2022).[8]

			<cbc:Description languageID="ENG">
				Premise
				A young woman, Bella, is brought back to life by her guardian, the scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter. Initially naïve, Bella is eager to learn about the world around her, albeit under Baxter's protection. Wanting to see more, she runs off with Duncan Wedderburn, a slick and debauched lawyer, and travels across continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella demands equality and liberation.[7]
				Development
				Lanthimos read Poor Things years prior to developing the film and met with the author, Alasdair Gray, in Scotland to acquire the rights. "He was a very lovely man," Lanthimos shared, "Unfortunately, he died just a couple of years before we actually made the film, but he was very special and energetic; he was 80-something [when we met], and as soon as I got there, he had seen Dogtooth and said, 'I had my friend put on the DVD, because I don’t know how to operate these things, but I think you're very talented, young man.'" Lanthimos shared that Gray took him on a personal tour of Glasgow, where Gray showed Lanthimos several places that he had incorporated into the story.[citation needed]
				While filming The Favourite (2018), Lanthimos revisited the project, which he discussed with Emma Stone, who also starred in the film. Lanthimos began developing Poor Things more actively following the success of The Favourite: “After the relative success of The Favourite, where I actually made a slightly more expensive film that was successful, people were more inclined to allow me to do whatever it is that I wanted, so I just went back to Gray’s book and said, ‘This is what I want to do.’ It was a long process, but the book was always on my mind.” While developing the film, Lanthimos and Stone collaborated with each other on the short film Bleat (2022).[8]
				Pre-production
				Poor Things was officially announced in February 2021.[9] Lanthimos felt that working with Stone again gave him an advantage to the production, as they developed a mutual trust towards one another. Stone also discussed how the process of making Poor Things was different in comparison to The Favourite, due to also acting as a producer: “It was so interesting to be involved in how the film was being pieced together, from cast to department heads to what have you. Ultimately, Yorgos was the one making those decisions, but I was very involved in the process, which started during the pandemic; we were reaching out to people and casting and everything during that time, because we couldn’t go anywhere.”[10]

			<cbc:Description languageID="ENG">
				Premise
				A young woman, Bella, is brought back to life by her guardian, the scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter. Initially naïve, Bella is eager to learn about the world around her, albeit under Baxter's protection. Wanting to see more, she runs off with Duncan Wedderburn, a slick and debauched lawyer, and travels across continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella demands equality and liberation.[7]
				Development
				Lanthimos read Poor Things years prior to developing the film and met with the author, Alasdair Gray, in Scotland to acquire the rights. "He was a very lovely man," Lanthimos shared, "Unfortunately, he died just a couple of years before we actually made the film, but he was very special and energetic; he was 80-something [when we met], and as soon as I got there, he had seen Dogtooth and said, 'I had my friend put on the DVD, because I don’t know how to operate these things, but I think you're very talented, young man.'" Lanthimos shared that Gray took him on a personal tour of Glasgow, where Gray showed Lanthimos several places that he had incorporated into the story.[citation needed]
				While filming The Favourite (2018), Lanthimos revisited the project, which he discussed with Emma Stone, who also starred in the film. Lanthimos began developing Poor Things more actively following the success of The Favourite: “After the relative success of The Favourite, where I actually made a slightly more expensive film that was successful, people were more inclined to allow me to do whatever it is that I wanted, so I just went back to Gray’s book and said, ‘This is what I want to do.’ It was a long process, but the book was always on my mind.” While developing the film, Lanthimos and Stone collaborated with each other on the short film Bleat (2022).[8]
				Pre-production
				Poor Things was officially announced in February 2021.[9] Lanthimos felt that working with Stone again gave him an advantage to the production, as they developed a mutual trust towards one another. Stone also discussed how the process of making Poor Things was different in comparison to The Favourite, due to also acting as a producer: “It was so interesting to be involved in how the film was being pieced together, from cast to department heads to what have you. Ultimately, Yorgos was the one making those decisions, but I was very involved in the process, which started during the pandemic; we were reaching out to people and casting and everything during that time, because we couldn’t go anywhere.”[10]

				A young woman, Bella, is brought back to life by her guardian, the scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter. Initially naïve, Bella is eager to learn about the world around her, albeit under Baxter's protection. Wanting to see more, she runs off with Duncan Wedderburn, a slick and debauched lawyer, and travels across continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella demands equality and liberation.[7]
				Development
				Lanthimos read Poor Things years prior to developing the film and met with the author, Alasdair Gray, in Scotland to acquire the rights. "He was a very lovely man," Lanthimos shared, "Unfortunately, he died just a couple of years before we actually made the film, but he was very special and energetic; he was 80-something [when we met], and as soon as I got there, he had seen Dogtooth and said, 'I had my friend put on the DVD, because I don’t know how to operate these things, but I think you're very talented, young man.'" Lanthimos shared that Gray took him on a personal tour of Glasgow, where Gray showed Lanthimos several places that he had incorporated into the story.[citation needed]
				While filming The Favourite (2018), Lanthimos revisited the project, which he discussed with Emma Stone, who also starred in the film. Lanthimos began developing Poor Things more actively following the success of The Favourite: “After the relative success of The Favourite, where I actually made a slightly more expensive film that was successful, people were more inclined to allow me to do whatever it is that I wanted, so I just went back to Gray’s book and said, ‘This is what I want to do.’ It was a long process, but the book was always on my mind.” While developing the film, Lanthimos and Stone collaborated with each other on the short film Bleat (2022).[8]
				Pre-production
				Poor Things was officially announced in February 2021.[9] Lanthimos felt that working with Stone again gave him an advantage to the production, as they developed a mutual trust towards one another. Stone also discussed how the process of making Poor Things was different in comparison to The Favourite, due to also acting as a producer: “It was so interesting to be involved in how the film was being pieced together, from cast to department heads to what have you. Ultimately, Yorgos was the one making those decisions, but I was very involved in the process, which started during the pandemic; we were reaching out to people and casting and everything during that time, because we couldn’t go anywhere.”[10]

				Premise
				A young woman, Bella, is brought back to life by her guardian, the scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter. Initially naïve, Bella is eager to learn about the world around her, albeit under Baxter's protection. Wanting to see more, she runs off with Duncan Wedderburn, a slick and debauched lawyer, and travels across continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella demands equality and liberation.[7]
				Development
				Lanthimos read Poor Things years prior to developing the film and met with the author, Alasdair Gray, in Scotland to acquire the rights. "He was a very lovely man," Lanthimos shared, "Unfortunately, he died just a couple of years before we actually made the film, but he was very special and energetic; he was 80-something [when we met], and as soon as I got there, he had seen Dogtooth and said, 'I had my friend put on the DVD, because I don’t know how to operate these things, but I think you're very talented, young man.'" Lanthimos shared that Gray took him on a personal tour of Glasgow, where Gray showed Lanthimos several places that he had incorporated into the story.[citation needed]
				While filming The Favourite (2018), Lanthimos revisited the project, which he discussed with Emma Stone, who also starred in the film. Lanthimos began developing Poor Things more actively following the success of The Favourite: “After the relative success of The Favourite, where I actually made a slightly more expensive film that was successful, people were more inclined to allow me to do whatever it is that I wanted, so I just went back to Gray’s book and said, ‘This is what I want to do.’ It was a long process, but the book was always on my mind.” While developing the film, Lanthimos and Stone collaborated with each other on the short film Bleat (2022).[8]
				Pre-production
				Poor Things was officially announced in February 2021.[9] Lanthimos felt that working with Stone again gave him an advantage to the production, as they developed a mutual trust towards one another. Stone also discussed how the process of making Poor Things was different in comparison to The Favourite, due to also acting as a producer: “It was so interesting to be involved in how the film was being pieced together, from cast to department heads to what have you. Ultimately, Yorgos was the one making those decisions, but I was very involved in the process, which started during the pandemic; we were reaching out to people and casting and everything during that time, because we couldn’t go anywhere.”[10]

Lanthimos began developing Poor Things more actively following the success of The Favourite: “After the relative success of The Favourite, where I actually made a slightly more expensive film that was successful, people were more inclined to allow me to do whatever it is that I wanted, so I just went back to Gray’s book and said, ‘This is what I want to do.’ It was a long process, but the book was always on my mind.” While developing the film, Lanthimos and Stone collaborated with each other on the short film Bleat (2022).[8]
				Pre-production
				Poor Things was officially announced in February 2021.[9] Lanthimos felt that working with Stone again gave him an advantage to the production, as they developed a mutual trust towards one another. Stone also discussed how the process of making Poor Things was different in comparison to The Favourite, due to also acting as a producer: “It was so interesting to be involved in how the film was being pieced together, from cast to department heads to what have you. Ultimately, Yorgos was the one making those decisions, but I was very involved in the process, which started during the pandemic; we were reaching out to people and casting and everything during that time, because we couldn’t go anywhere.”[10]

				Premise
				A young woman, Bella, is brought back to life by her guardian, the scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter. Initially naïve, Bella is eager to learn about the world around her, albeit under Baxter's protection. Wanting to see more, she runs off with Duncan Wedderburn, a slick and debauched lawyer, and travels across continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella demands equality and liberation.[7]

				Lanthimos read Poor Things years prior to developing the film and met with the author, Alasdair Gray, in Scotland to acquire the rights. "He was a very lovely man," Lanthimos shared, "Unfortunately, he died just a couple of years before we actually made the film, but he was very special and energetic; he was 80-something [when we met], and as soon as I got there, he had seen Dogtooth and said, 'I had my friend put on the DVD, because I don’t know how to operate these things, but I think you're very talented, young man.'"

				Premise
				A young woman, Bella, is brought back to life by her guardian, the scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter. Initially naïve, Bella is eager to learn about the world around her, albeit under Baxter's protection. Wanting to see more, she runs off with Duncan Wedderburn, a slick and debauched lawyer, and travels across continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella demands equality and liberation.[7]
				Development
				Lanthimos read Poor Things years prior to developing the film and met with the author, Alasdair Gray, in Scotland to acquire the rights. "He was a very lovely man," Lanthimos shared, "Unfortunately, he died just a couple of years before we actually made the film, but he was very special and energetic; he was 80-something [when we met], and as soon as I got there, he had seen Dogtooth and said, 'I had my friend put on the DVD, because I don’t know how to operate these things, but I think you're very talented, young man.'" Lanthimos shared that Gray took him on a personal tour of Glasgow, where Gray showed Lanthimos several places that he had incorporated into the story.[citation needed]
				While filming The Favourite (2018), Lanthimos revisited the project, which he discussed with Emma Stone, who also starred in the film. Lanthimos began developing Poor Things more actively following the success of The Favourite: “After the relative success of The Favourite, where I actually made a slightly more expensive film that was successful, people were more inclined to allow me to do whatever it is that I wanted, so I just went back to Gray’s book and said, ‘This is what I want to do.’ It was a long process, but the book was always on my mind.” While developing the film, Lanthimos and Stone collaborated with each other on the short film Bleat (2022).[8]
				Pre-production
				Poor Things was officially announced in February 2021.[9] Lanthimos felt that working with Stone again gave him an advantage to the production, as they developed a mutual trust towards one another. Stone also discussed how the process of making Poor Things was different in comparison to The Favourite, due to also acting as a producer: “It was so interesting to be involved in how the film was being pieced together, from cast to department heads to what have you. Ultimately, Yorgos was the one making those decisions, but I was very involved in the process, which started during the pandemic; we were reaching out to people and casting and everything during that time, because we couldn’t go anywhere.”[10]

Ultimately, Yorgos was the one making those decisions, but I was very involved in the process, which started during the pandemic; we were reaching out to people and casting and everything during that time, because we couldn’t go anywhere.”[10]

				Premise
				A young woman, Bella, is brought back to life by her guardian, the scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter. Initially naïve, Bella is eager to learn about the world around her, albeit under Baxter's protection. Wanting to see more, she runs off with Duncan Wedderburn, a slick and debauched lawyer, and travels across continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella demands equality and liberation.[7]
				Development
				Lanthimos read Poor Things years prior to developing the film and met with the author, Alasdair Gray, in Scotland to acquire the rights. "He was a very lovely man," Lanthimos shared, "Unfortunately, he died just a couple of years before we actually made the film, but he was very special and energetic; he was 80-something [when we met], and as soon as I got there, he had seen Dogtooth and said, 'I had my friend put on the DVD, because I don’t know how to operate these things, but I think you're very talented, young man.'" Lanthimos shared that Gray took him on a personal tour of Glasgow, where Gray showed Lanthimos several places that he had incorporated into the story.[citation needed]
				While filming The Favourite (2018), Lanthimos revisited the project, which he discussed with Emma Stone, who also starred in the film. Lanthimos began developing Poor Things more actively following the success of The Favourite: “After the relative success of The Favourite, where I actually made a slightly more expensive film that was successful, people were more inclined to allow me to do whatever it is that I wanted, so I just went back to Gray’s book and said, ‘This is what I want to do.’ It was a long process, but the book was always on my mind.” While developing the film, Lanthimos and Stone collaborated with each other on the short film Bleat (2022).[8]

			<cbc:Description languageID="ENG">
				Premise
				A young woman, Bella, is brought back to life by her guardian, the scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter. Initially naïve, Bella is eager to learn about the world around her, albeit under Baxter's protection. Wanting to see more, she runs off with Duncan Wedderburn, a slick and debauched lawyer, and travels across continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella demands equality and liberation.[7]
				Development
				Lanthimos read Poor Things years prior to developing the film and met with the author, Alasdair Gray, in Scotland to acquire the rights. "He was a very lovely man," Lanthimos shared, "Unfortunately, he died just a couple of years before we actually made the film, but he was very special and energetic; he was 80-something [when we met], and as soon as I got there, he had seen Dogtooth and said, 'I had my friend put on the DVD, because I don’t know how to operate these things, but I think you're very talented, young man.'" Lanthimos shared that Gray took him on a personal tour of Glasgow, where Gray showed Lanthimos several places that he had incorporated into the story.[citation needed]
				While filming The Favourite (2018), Lanthimos revisited the project, which he discussed with Emma Stone, who also starred in the film. Lanthimos began developing Poor Things more actively following the success of The Favourite: “After the relative success of The Favourite, where I actually made a slightly more expensive film that was successful, people were more inclined to allow me to do whatever it is that I wanted, so I just went back to Gray’s book and said, ‘This is what I want to do.’ It was a long process, but the book was always on my mind.” While developing the film, Lanthimos and Stone collaborated with each other on the short film Bleat (2022).[8]
				Pre-production
				Poor Things was officially announced in February 2021.[9] Lanthimos felt that working with Stone again gave him an advantage to the production, as they developed a mutual trust towards one another. Stone also discussed how the process of making Poor Things was different in comparison to The Favourite, due to also acting as a producer: “It was so interesting to be involved in how the film was being pieced together, from cast to department heads to what have you. Ultimately, Yorgos was the one making those decisions, but I was very involved in the process, which started during the pandemic; we were reaching out to people and casting and everything during that time, because we couldn’t go anywhere.”[10]

				Premise
				A young woman, Bella, is brought back to life by her guardian, the scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter. Initially naïve, Bella is eager to learn about the world around her, albeit under Baxter's protection. Wanting to see more, she runs off with Duncan Wedderburn, a slick and debauched lawyer, and travels across continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella demands equality and liberation.[7]
				Development
				Lanthimos read Poor Things years prior to developing the film and met with the author, Alasdair Gray, in Scotland to acquire the rights. "He was a very lovely man," Lanthimos shared, "Unfortunately, he died just a couple of years before we actually made the film, but he was very special and energetic; he was 80-something [when we met], and as soon as I got there, he had seen Dogtooth and said, 'I had my friend put on the DVD, because I don’t know how to operate these things, but I think you're very talented, young man.'" Lanthimos shared that Gray took him on a personal tour of Glasgow, where Gray showed Lanthimos several places that he had incorporated into the story.[citation needed]
				While filming The Favourite (2018), Lanthimos revisited the project, which he discussed with Emma Stone, who also starred in the film. Lanthimos began developing Poor Things more actively following the success of The Favourite: “After the relative success of The Favourite, where I actually made a slightly more expensive film that was successful, people were more inclined to allow me to do whatever it is that I wanted, so I just went back to Gray’s book and said, ‘This is what I want to do.’ It was a long process, but the book was always on my mind.” While developing the film, Lanthimos and Stone collaborated with each other on the short film Bleat (2022).[8]
				Pre-production
				Poor Things was officially announced in February 2021.[9] Lanthimos felt that working with Stone again gave him an advantage to the production, as they developed a mutual trust towards one another. Stone also discussed how the process of making Poor Things was different in comparison to The Favourite, due to also acting as a producer: “It was so interesting to be involved in how the film was being pieced together, from cast to department heads to what have you. Ultimately, Yorgos was the one making those decisions, but I was very involved in the process, which started during the pandemic; we were reaching out to people and casting and everything during that time, because we couldn’t go anywhere.”[10]

				A young woman, Bella, is brought back to life by her guardian, the scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter. Initially naïve, Bella is eager to learn about the world around her, albeit under Baxter's protection. Wanting to see more, she runs off with Duncan Wedderburn, a slick and debauched lawyer, and travels across continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella demands equality and liberation.[7]
				Development
				Lanthimos read Poor Things years prior to developing the film and met with the author, Alasdair Gray, in Scotland to acquire the rights. "He was a very lovely man," Lanthimos shared, "Unfortunately, he died just a couple of years before we actually made the film, but he was very special and energetic; he was 80-something [when we met], and as soon as I got there, he had seen Dogtooth and said, 'I had my friend put on the DVD, because I don’t know how to operate these things, but I think you're very talented, young man.'" Lanthimos shared that Gray took him on a personal tour of Glasgow, where Gray showed Lanthimos several places that he had incorporated into the story.[citation needed]
				While filming The Favourite (2018), Lanthimos revisited the project, which he discussed with Emma Stone, who also starred in the film. Lanthimos began developing Poor Things more actively following the success of The Favourite: “After the relative success of The Favourite, where I actually made a slightly more expensive film that was successful, people were more inclined to allow me to do whatever it is that I wanted, so I just went back to Gray’s book and said, ‘This is what I want to do.’ It was a long process, but the book was always on my mind.” While developing the film, Lanthimos and Stone collaborated with each other on the short film Bleat (2022).[8]
				Pre-production
				Poor Things was officially announced in February 2021.[9] Lanthimos felt that working with Stone again gave him an advantage to the production, as they developed a mutual trust towards one another. Stone also discussed how the process of making Poor Things was different in comparison to The Favourite, due to also acting as a producer: “It was so interesting to be involved in how the film was being pieced together, from cast to department heads to what have you. Ultimately, Yorgos was the one making those decisions, but I was very involved in the process, which started during the pandemic; we were reaching out to people and casting and everything during that time, because we couldn’t go anywhere.”[10]

				Premise
				A young woman, Bella, is brought back to life by her guardian, the scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter. Initially naïve, Bella is eager to learn about the world around her, albeit under Baxter's protection. Wanting to see more, she runs off with Duncan Wedderburn, a slick and debauched lawyer, and travels across continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella demands equality and liberation.[7]
				Development
				Lanthimos read Poor Things years prior to developing the film and met with the author, Alasdair Gray, in Scotland to acquire the rights. "He was a very lovely man," Lanthimos shared, "Unfortunately, he died just a couple of years before we actually made the film, but he was very special and energetic; he was 80-something [when we met], and as soon as I got there, he had seen Dogtooth and said, 'I had my friend put on the DVD, because I don’t know how to operate these things, but I think you're very talented, young man.'" Lanthimos shared that Gray took him on a personal tour of Glasgow, where Gray showed Lanthimos several places that he had incorporated into the story.[citation needed]
				While filming The Favourite (2018), Lanthimos revisited the project, which he discussed with Emma Stone, who also starred in the film. Lanthimos began developing Poor Things more actively following the success of The Favourite: “After the relative success of The Favourite, where I actually made a slightly more expensive film that was successful, people were more inclined to allow me to do whatever it is that I wanted, so I just went back to Gray’s book and said, ‘This is what I want to do.’ It was a long process, but the book was always on my mind.” While developing the film, Lanthimos and Stone collaborated with each other on the short film Bleat (2022).[8]
				Pre-production
				Poor Things was officially announced in February 2021.[9] Lanthimos felt that working with Stone again gave him an advantage to the production, as they developed a mutual trust towards one another. Stone also discussed how the process of making Poor Things was different in comparison to The Favourite, due to also acting as a producer: “It was so interesting to be involved in how the film was being pieced together, from cast to department heads to what have you. Ultimately, Yorgos was the one making those decisions, but I was very involved in the process, which started during the pandemic; we were reaching out to people and casting and everything during that time, because we couldn’t go anywhere.”[10]

Lanthimos began developing Poor Things more actively following the success of The Favourite: “After the relative success of The Favourite, where I actually made a slightly more expensive film that was successful, people were more inclined to allow me to do whatever it is that I wanted, so I just went back to Gray’s book and said, ‘This is what I want to do.’ It was a long process, but the book was always on my mind.” While developing the film, Lanthimos and Stone collaborated with each other on the short film Bleat (2022).[8]
				Pre-production
				Poor Things was officially announced in February 2021.[9] Lanthimos felt that working with Stone again gave him an advantage to the production, as they developed a mutual trust towards one another. Stone also discussed how the process of making Poor Things was different in comparison to The Favourite, due to also acting as a producer: “It was so interesting to be involved in how the film was being pieced together, from cast to department heads to what have you. Ultimately, Yorgos was the one making those decisions, but I was very involved in the process, which started during the pandemic; we were reaching out to people and casting and everything during that time, because we couldn’t go anywhere.”[10]

				Premise
				A young woman, Bella, is brought back to life by her guardian, the scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter. Initially naïve, Bella is eager to learn about the world around her, albeit under Baxter's protection. Wanting to see more, she runs off with Duncan Wedderburn, a slick and debauched lawyer, and travels across continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella demands equality and liberation.[7]

"He was a very lovely man," Lanthimos shared, "Unfortunately, he died just a couple of years before we actually made the film, but he was very special and energetic; he was 80-something [when we met], and as soon as I got there, he had seen Dogtooth and said, 'I had my friend put on the DVD, because I don’t know how to operate these things, but I think you're very talented, young man.'"

				Premise
				A young woman, Bella, is brought back to life by her guardian, the scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter. Initially naïve, Bella is eager to learn about the world around her, albeit under Baxter's protection. Wanting to see more, she runs off with Duncan Wedderburn, a slick and debauched lawyer, and travels across continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella demands equality and liberation.[7]
				Development
				Lanthimos read Poor Things years prior to developing the film and met with the author, Alasdair Gray, in Scotland to acquire the rights. "He was a very lovely man," Lanthimos shared, "Unfortunately, he died just a couple of years before we actually made the film, but he was very special and energetic; he was 80-something [when we met], and as soon as I got there, he had seen Dogtooth and said, 'I had my friend put on the DVD, because I don’t know how to operate these things, but I think you're very talented, young man.'" Lanthimos shared that Gray took him on a personal tour of Glasgow, where Gray showed Lanthimos several places that he had incorporated into the story.[citation needed]
				While filming The Favourite (2018), Lanthimos revisited the project, which he discussed with Emma Stone, who also starred in the film. Lanthimos began developing Poor Things more actively following the success of The Favourite: “After the relative success of The Favourite, where I actually made a slightly more expensive film that was successful, people were more inclined to allow me to do whatever it is that I wanted, so I just went back to Gray’s book and said, ‘This is what I want to do.’ It was a long process, but the book was always on my mind.” While developing the film, Lanthimos and Stone collaborated with each other on the short film Bleat (2022).[8]
				Pre-production
				Poor Things was officially announced in February 2021.[9] Lanthimos felt that working with Stone again gave him an advantage to the production, as they developed a mutual trust towards one another. Stone also discussed how the process of making Poor Things was different in comparison to The Favourite, due to also acting as a producer: “It was so interesting to be involved in how the film was being pieced together, from cast to department heads to what have you. Ultimately, Yorgos was the one making those decisions, but I was very involved in the process, which started during the pandemic; we were reaching out to people and casting and everything during that time, because we couldn’t go anywhere.”[10]

Ultimately, Yorgos was the one making those decisions, but I was very involved in the process, which started during the pandemic; we were reaching out to people and casting and everything during that time, because we couldn’t go anywhere.”[10]

				Premise
				A young woman, Bella, is brought back to life by her guardian, the scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter. Initially naïve, Bella is eager to learn about the world around her, albeit under Baxter's protection. Wanting to see more, she runs off with Duncan Wedderburn, a slick and debauched lawyer, and travels across continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella demands equality and liberation.[7]
				Development
				Lanthimos read Poor Things years prior to developing the film and met with the author, Alasdair Gray, in Scotland to acquire the rights. "He was a very lovely man," Lanthimos shared, "Unfortunately, he died just a couple of years before we actually made the film, but he was very special and energetic; he was 80-something [when we met], and as soon as I got there, he had seen Dogtooth and said, 'I had my friend put on the DVD, because I don’t know how to operate these things, but I think you're very talented, young man.'" Lanthimos shared that Gray took him on a personal tour of Glasgow, where Gray showed Lanthimos several places that he had incorporated into the story.[citation needed]
				While filming The Favourite (2018), Lanthimos revisited the project, which he discussed with Emma Stone, who also starred in the film. Lanthimos began developing Poor Things more actively following the success of The Favourite: “After the relative success of The Favourite, where I actually made a slightly more expensive film that was successful, people were more inclined to allow me to do whatever it is that I wanted, so I just went back to Gray’s book and said, ‘This is what I want to do.’ It was a long process, but the book was always on my mind.” While developing the film, Lanthimos and Stone collaborated with each other on the short film Bleat (2022).[8]

			<cbc:Description languageID="ENG">
				Premise
				A young woman, Bella, is brought back to life by her guardian, the scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter. Initially naïve, Bella is eager to learn about the world around her, albeit under Baxter's protection. Wanting to see more, she runs off with Duncan Wedderburn, a slick and debauched lawyer, and travels across continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella demands equality and liberation.[7]
				Development
				Lanthimos read Poor Things years prior to developing the film and met with the author, Alasdair Gray, in Scotland to acquire the rights. "He was a very lovely man," Lanthimos shared, "Unfortunately, he died just a couple of years before we actually made the film, but he was very special and energetic; he was 80-something [when we met], and as soon as I got there, he had seen Dogtooth and said, 'I had my friend put on the DVD, because I don’t know how to operate these things, but I think you're very talented, young man.'" Lanthimos shared that Gray took him on a personal tour of Glasgow, where Gray showed Lanthimos several places that he had incorporated into the story.[citation needed]
				While filming The Favourite (2018), Lanthimos revisited the project, which he discussed with Emma Stone, who also starred in the film. Lanthimos began developing Poor Things more actively following the success of The Favourite: “After the relative success of The Favourite, where I actually made a slightly more expensive film that was successful, people were more inclined to allow me to do whatever it is that I wanted, so I just went back to Gray’s book and said, ‘This is what I want to do.’ It was a long process, but the book was always on my mind.” While developing the film, Lanthimos and Stone collaborated with each other on the short film Bleat (2022).[8]
				Pre-production
				Poor Things was officially announced in February 2021.[9] Lanthimos felt that working with Stone again gave him an advantage to the production, as they developed a mutual trust towards one another. Stone also discussed how the process of making Poor Things was different in comparison to The Favourite, due to also acting as a producer: “It was so interesting to be involved in how the film was being pieced together, from cast to department heads to what have you. Ultimately, Yorgos was the one making those decisions, but I was very involved in the process, which started during the pandemic; we were reaching out to people and casting and everything during that time, because we couldn’t go anywhere.”[10]

				Premise
				A young woman, Bella, is brought back to life by her guardian, the scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter. Initially naïve, Bella is eager to learn about the world around her, albeit under Baxter's protection. Wanting to see more, she runs off with Duncan Wedderburn, a slick and debauched lawyer, and travels across continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella demands equality and liberation.[7]
				Development
				Lanthimos read Poor Things years prior to developing the film and met with the author, Alasdair Gray, in Scotland to acquire the rights. "He was a very lovely man," Lanthimos shared, "Unfortunately, he died just a couple of years before we actually made the film, but he was very special and energetic; he was 80-something [when we met], and as soon as I got there, he had seen Dogtooth and said, 'I had my friend put on the DVD, because I don’t know how to operate these things, but I think you're very talented, young man.'" Lanthimos shared that Gray took him on a personal tour of Glasgow, where Gray showed Lanthimos several places that he had incorporated into the story.[citation needed]
				While filming The Favourite (2018), Lanthimos revisited the project, which he discussed with Emma Stone, who also starred in the film. Lanthimos began developing Poor Things more actively following the success of The Favourite: “After the relative success of The Favourite, where I actually made a slightly more expensive film that was successful, people were more inclined to allow me to do whatever it is that I wanted, so I just went back to Gray’s book and said, ‘This is what I want to do.’ It was a long process, but the book was always on my mind.” While developing the film, Lanthimos and Stone collaborated with each other on the short film Bleat (2022).[8]
				Pre-production
				Poor Things was officially announced in February 2021.[9] Lanthimos felt that working with Stone again gave him an advantage to the production, as they developed a mutual trust towards one another. Stone also discussed how the process of making Poor Things was different in comparison to The Favourite, due to also acting as a producer: “It was so interesting to be involved in how the film was being pieced together, from cast to department heads to what have you. Ultimately, Yorgos was the one making those decisions, but I was very involved in the process, which started during the pandemic; we were reaching out to people and casting and everything during that time, because we couldn’t go anywhere.”[10]

				A young woman, Bella, is brought back to life by her guardian, the scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter. Initially naïve, Bella is eager to learn about the world around her, albeit under Baxter's protection. Wanting to see more, she runs off with Duncan Wedderburn, a slick and debauched lawyer, and travels across continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella demands equality and liberation.[7]
				Development
				Lanthimos read Poor Things years prior to developing the film and met with the author, Alasdair Gray, in Scotland to acquire the rights. "He was a very lovely man," Lanthimos shared, "Unfortunately, he died just a couple of years before we actually made the film, but he was very special and energetic; he was 80-something [when we met], and as soon as I got there, he had seen Dogtooth and said, 'I had my friend put on the DVD, because I don’t know how to operate these things, but I think you're very talented, young man.'" Lanthimos shared that Gray took him on a personal tour of Glasgow, where Gray showed Lanthimos several places that he had incorporated into the story.[citation needed]
				While filming The Favourite (2018), Lanthimos revisited the project, which he discussed with Emma Stone, who also starred in the film. Lanthimos began developing Poor Things more actively following the success of The Favourite: “After the relative success of The Favourite, where I actually made a slightly more expensive film that was successful, people were more inclined to allow me to do whatever it is that I wanted, so I just went back to Gray’s book and said, ‘This is what I want to do.’ It was a long process, but the book was always on my mind.” While developing the film, Lanthimos and Stone collaborated with each other on the short film Bleat (2022).[8]
				Pre-production
				Poor Things was officially announced in February 2021.[9] Lanthimos felt that working with Stone again gave him an advantage to the production, as they developed a mutual trust towards one another. Stone also discussed how the process of making Poor Things was different in comparison to The Favourite, due to also acting as a producer: “It was so interesting to be involved in how the film was being pieced together, from cast to department heads to what have you. Ultimately, Yorgos was the one making those decisions, but I was very involved in the process, which started during the pandemic; we were reaching out to people and casting and everything during that time, because we couldn’t go anywhere.”[10]

				Premise
				A young woman, Bella, is brought back to life by her guardian, the scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter. Initially naïve, Bella is eager to learn about the world around her, albeit under Baxter's protection. Wanting to see more, she runs off with Duncan Wedderburn, a slick and debauched lawyer, and travels across continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella demands equality and liberation.[7]
				Development
				Lanthimos read Poor Things years prior to developing the film and met with the author, Alasdair Gray, in Scotland to acquire the rights. "He was a very lovely man," Lanthimos shared, "Unfortunately, he died just a couple of years before we actually made the film, but he was very special and energetic; he was 80-something [when we met], and as soon as I got there, he had seen Dogtooth and said, 'I had my friend put on the DVD, because I don’t know how to operate these things, but I think you're very talented, young man.'" Lanthimos shared that Gray took him on a personal tour of Glasgow, where Gray showed Lanthimos several places that he had incorporated into the story.[citation needed]
				While filming The Favourite (2018), Lanthimos revisited the project, which he discussed with Emma Stone, who also starred in the film. Lanthimos began developing Poor Things more actively following the success of The Favourite: “After the relative success of The Favourite, where I actually made a slightly more expensive film that was successful, people were more inclined to allow me to do whatever it is that I wanted, so I just went back to Gray’s book and said, ‘This is what I want to do.’ It was a long process, but the book was always on my mind.” While developing the film, Lanthimos and Stone collaborated with each other on the short film Bleat (2022).[8]
				Pre-production
				Poor Things was officially announced in February 2021.[9] Lanthimos felt that working with Stone again gave him an advantage to the production, as they developed a mutual trust towards one another. Stone also discussed how the process of making Poor Things was different in comparison to The Favourite, due to also acting as a producer: “It was so interesting to be involved in how the film was being pieced together, from cast to department heads to what have you. Ultimately, Yorgos was the one making those decisions, but I was very involved in the process, which started during the pandemic; we were reaching out to people and casting and everything during that time, because we couldn’t go anywhere.”[10]

Lanthimos began developing Poor Things more actively following the success of The Favourite: “After the relative success of The Favourite, where I actually made a slightly more expensive film that was successful, people were more inclined to allow me to do whatever it is that I wanted, so I just went back to Gray’s book and said, ‘This is what I want to do.’ It was a long process, but the book was always on my mind.” While developing the film, Lanthimos and Stone collaborated with each other on the short film Bleat (2022).[8]
				Pre-production
				Poor Things was officially announced in February 2021.[9] Lanthimos felt that working with Stone again gave him an advantage to the production, as they developed a mutual trust towards one another. Stone also discussed how the process of making Poor Things was different in comparison to The Favourite, due to also acting as a producer: “It was so interesting to be involved in how the film was being pieced together, from cast to department heads to what have you. Ultimately, Yorgos was the one making those decisions, but I was very involved in the process, which started during the pandemic; we were reaching out to people and casting and everything during that time, because we couldn’t go anywhere.”[10]

				Premise
				A young woman, Bella, is brought back to life by her guardian, the scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter. Initially naïve, Bella is eager to learn about the world around her, albeit under Baxter's protection. Wanting to see more, she runs off with Duncan Wedderburn, a slick and debauched lawyer, and travels across continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella demands equality and liberation.[7]

"He was a very lovely man," Lanthimos shared, "Unfortunately, he died just a couple of years before we actually made the film, but he was very special and energetic; he was 80-something [when we met], and as soon as I got there, he had seen Dogtooth and said, 'I had my friend put on the DVD, because I don’t know how to operate these things, but I think you're very talented, young man.'"

				Premise
				A young woman, Bella, is brought back to life by her guardian, the scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter. Initially naïve, Bella is eager to learn about the world around her, albeit under Baxter's protection. Wanting to see more, she runs off with Duncan Wedderburn, a slick and debauched lawyer, and travels across continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella demands equality and liberation.[7]
				Development
				Lanthimos read Poor Things years prior to developing the film and met with the author, Alasdair Gray, in Scotland to acquire the rights. "He was a very lovely man," Lanthimos shared, "Unfortunately, he died just a couple of years before we actually made the film, but he was very special and energetic; he was 80-something [when we met], and as soon as I got there, he had seen Dogtooth and said, 'I had my friend put on the DVD, because I don’t know how to operate these things, but I think you're very talented, young man.'" Lanthimos shared that Gray took him on a personal tour of Glasgow, where Gray showed Lanthimos several places that he had incorporated into the story.[citation needed]
				While filming The Favourite (2018), Lanthimos revisited the project, which he discussed with Emma Stone, who also starred in the film. Lanthimos began developing Poor Things more actively following the success of The Favourite: “After the relative success of The Favourite, where I actually made a slightly more expensive film that was successful, people were more inclined to allow me to do whatever it is that I wanted, so I just went back to Gray’s book and said, ‘This is what I want to do.’ It was a long process, but the book was always on my mind.” While developing the film, Lanthimos and Stone collaborated with each other on the short film Bleat (2022).[8]
				Pre-production
				Poor Things was officially announced in February 2021.[9] Lanthimos felt that working with Stone again gave him an advantage to the production, as they developed a mutual trust towards one another. Stone also discussed how the process of making Poor Things was different in comparison to The Favourite, due to also acting as a producer: “It was so interesting to be involved in how the film was being pieced together, from cast to department heads to what have you. Ultimately, Yorgos was the one making those decisions, but I was very involved in the process, which started during the pandemic; we were reaching out to people and casting and everything during that time, because we couldn’t go anywhere.”[10]

Ultimately, Yorgos was the one making those decisions, but I was very involved in the process, which started during the pandemic; we were reaching out to people and casting and everything during that time, because we couldn’t go anywhere.”[10]

				Premise
				A young woman, Bella, is brought back to life by her guardian, the scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter. Initially naïve, Bella is eager to learn about the world around her, albeit under Baxter's protection. Wanting to see more, she runs off with Duncan Wedderburn, a slick and debauched lawyer, and travels across continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella demands equality and liberation.[7]
				Development
				Lanthimos read Poor Things years prior to developing the film and met with the author, Alasdair Gray, in Scotland to acquire the rights. "He was a very lovely man," Lanthimos shared, "Unfortunately, he died just a couple of years before we actually made the film, but he was very special and energetic; he was 80-something [when we met], and as soon as I got there, he had seen Dogtooth and said, 'I had my friend put on the DVD, because I don’t know how to operate these things, but I think you're very talented, young man.'" Lanthimos shared that Gray took him on a personal tour of Glasgow, where Gray showed Lanthimos several places that he had incorporated into the story.[citation needed]
				While filming The Favourite (2018), Lanthimos revisited the project, which he discussed with Emma Stone, who also starred in the film. Lanthimos began developing Poor Things more actively following the success of The Favourite: “After the relative success of The Favourite, where I actually made a slightly more expensive film that was successful, people were more inclined to allow me to do whatever it is that I wanted, so I just went back to Gray’s book and said, ‘This is what I want to do.’ It was a long process, but the book was always on my mind.” While developing the film, Lanthimos and Stone collaborated with each other on the short film Bleat (2022).[8]

				Premise
				A young woman, Bella, is brought back to life by her guardian, the scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter. Initially naïve, Bella is eager to learn about the world around her, albeit under Baxter's protection. Wanting to see more, she runs off with Duncan Wedderburn, a slick and debauched lawyer, and travels across continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella demands equality and liberation.[7]
				Development
				Lanthimos read Poor Things years prior to developing the film and met with the author, Alasdair Gray, in Scotland to acquire the rights. "He was a very lovely man," Lanthimos shared, "Unfortunately, he died just a couple of years before we actually made the film, but he was very special and energetic; he was 80-something [when we met], and as soon as I got there, he had seen Dogtooth and said, 'I had my friend put on the DVD, because I don’t know how to operate these things, but I think you're very talented, young man.'" Lanthimos shared that Gray took him on a personal tour of Glasgow, where Gray showed Lanthimos several places that he had incorporated into the story.[citation needed]
				While filming The Favourite (2018), Lanthimos revisited the project, which he discussed with Emma Stone, who also starred in the film. Lanthimos began developing Poor Things more actively following the success of The Favourite: “After the relative success of The Favourite, where I actually made a slightly more expensive film that was successful, people were more inclined to allow me to do whatever it is that I wanted, so I just went back to Gray’s book and said, ‘This is what I want to do.’ It was a long process, but the book was always on my mind.” While developing the film, Lanthimos and Stone collaborated with each other on the short film Bleat (2022).[8]
				Pre-production
				Poor Things was officially announced in February 2021.[9] Lanthimos felt that working with Stone again gave him an advantage to the production, as they developed a mutual trust towards one another. Stone also discussed how the process of making Poor Things was different in comparison to The Favourite, due to also acting as a producer: “It was so interesting to be involved in how the film was being pieced together, from cast to department heads to what have you. Ultimately, Yorgos was the one making those decisions, but I was very involved in the process, which started during the pandemic; we were reaching out to people and casting and everything during that time, because we couldn’t go anywhere.”[10]

				Premise
				A young woman, Bella, is brought back to life by her guardian, the scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter. Initially naïve, Bella is eager to learn about the world around her, albeit under Baxter's protection. Wanting to see more, she runs off with Duncan Wedderburn, a slick and debauched lawyer, and travels across continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella demands equality and liberation.[7]
				Development
				Lanthimos read Poor Things years prior to developing the film and met with the author, Alasdair Gray, in Scotland to acquire the rights. "He was a very lovely man," Lanthimos shared, "Unfortunately, he died just a couple of years before we actually made the film, but he was very special and energetic; he was 80-something [when we met], and as soon as I got there, he had seen Dogtooth and said, 'I had my friend put on the DVD, because I don’t know how to operate these things, but I think you're very talented, young man.'" Lanthimos shared that Gray took him on a personal tour of Glasgow, where Gray showed Lanthimos several places that he had incorporated into the story.[citation needed]
				While filming The Favourite (2018), Lanthimos revisited the project, which he discussed with Emma Stone, who also starred in the film. Lanthimos began developing Poor Things more actively following the success of The Favourite: “After the relative success of The Favourite, where I actually made a slightly more expensive film that was successful, people were more inclined to allow me to do whatever it is that I wanted, so I just went back to Gray’s book and said, ‘This is what I want to do.’ It was a long process, but the book was always on my mind.” While developing the film, Lanthimos and Stone collaborated with each other on the short film Bleat (2022).[8]
				Pre-production
				Poor Things was officially announced in February 2021.[9] Lanthimos felt that working with Stone again gave him an advantage to the production, as they developed a mutual trust towards one another. Stone also discussed how the process of making Poor Things was different in comparison to The Favourite, due to also acting as a producer: “It was so interesting to be involved in how the film was being pieced together, from cast to department heads to what have you. Ultimately, Yorgos was the one making those decisions, but I was very involved in the process, which started during the pandemic; we were reaching out to people and casting and everything during that time, because we couldn’t go anywhere.”[10]

				A young woman, Bella, is brought back to life by her guardian, the scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter. Initially naïve, Bella is eager to learn about the world around her, albeit under Baxter's protection. Wanting to see more, she runs off with Duncan Wedderburn, a slick and debauched lawyer, and travels across continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella demands equality and liberation.[7]
				Development
				Lanthimos read Poor Things years prior to developing the film and met with the author, Alasdair Gray, in Scotland to acquire the rights. "He was a very lovely man," Lanthimos shared, "Unfortunately, he died just a couple of years before we actually made the film, but he was very special and energetic; he was 80-something [when we met], and as soon as I got there, he had seen Dogtooth and said, 'I had my friend put on the DVD, because I don’t know how to operate these things, but I think you're very talented, young man.'" Lanthimos shared that Gray took him on a personal tour of Glasgow, where Gray showed Lanthimos several places that he had incorporated into the story.[citation needed]
				While filming The Favourite (2018), Lanthimos revisited the project, which he discussed with Emma Stone, who also starred in the film. Lanthimos began developing Poor Things more actively following the success of The Favourite: “After the relative success of The Favourite, where I actually made a slightly more expensive film that was successful, people were more inclined to allow me to do whatever it is that I wanted, so I just went back to Gray’s book and said, ‘This is what I want to do.’ It was a long process, but the book was always on my mind.” While developing the film, Lanthimos and Stone collaborated with each other on the short film Bleat (2022).[8]
				Pre-production
				Poor Things was officially announced in February 2021.[9] Lanthimos felt that working with Stone again gave him an advantage to the production, as they developed a mutual trust towards one another. Stone also discussed how the process of making Poor Things was different in comparison to The Favourite, due to also acting as a producer: “It was so interesting to be involved in how the film was being pieced together, from cast to department heads to what have you. Ultimately, Yorgos was the one making those decisions, but I was very involved in the process, which started during the pandemic; we were reaching out to people and casting and everything during that time, because we couldn’t go anywhere.”[10]

				Premise
				A young woman, Bella, is brought back to life by her guardian, the scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter. Initially naïve, Bella is eager to learn about the world around her, albeit under Baxter's protection. Wanting to see more, she runs off with Duncan Wedderburn, a slick and debauched lawyer, and travels across continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella demands equality and liberation.[7]
				Development
				Lanthimos read Poor Things years prior to developing the film and met with the author, Alasdair Gray, in Scotland to acquire the rights. "He was a very lovely man," Lanthimos shared, "Unfortunately, he died just a couple of years before we actually made the film, but he was very special and energetic; he was 80-something [when we met], and as soon as I got there, he had seen Dogtooth and said, 'I had my friend put on the DVD, because I don’t know how to operate these things, but I think you're very talented, young man.'" Lanthimos shared that Gray took him on a personal tour of Glasgow, where Gray showed Lanthimos several places that he had incorporated into the story.[citation needed]
				While filming The Favourite (2018), Lanthimos revisited the project, which he discussed with Emma Stone, who also starred in the film. Lanthimos began developing Poor Things more actively following the success of The Favourite: “After the relative success of The Favourite, where I actually made a slightly more expensive film that was successful, people were more inclined to allow me to do whatever it is that I wanted, so I just went back to Gray’s book and said, ‘This is what I want to do.’ It was a long process, but the book was always on my mind.” While developing the film, Lanthimos and Stone collaborated with each other on the short film Bleat (2022).[8]
				Pre-production
				Poor Things was officially announced in February 2021.[9] Lanthimos felt that working with Stone again gave him an advantage to the production, as they developed a mutual trust towards one another. Stone also discussed how the process of making Poor Things was different in comparison to The Favourite, due to also acting as a producer: “It was so interesting to be involved in how the film was being pieced together, from cast to department heads to what have you. Ultimately, Yorgos was the one making those decisions, but I was very involved in the process, which started during the pandemic; we were reaching out to people and casting and everything during that time, because we couldn’t go anywhere.”[10]

Lanthimos began developing Poor Things more actively following the success of The Favourite: “After the relative success of The Favourite, where I actually made a slightly more expensive film that was successful, people were more inclined to allow me to do whatever it is that I wanted, so I just went back to Gray’s book and said, ‘This is what I want to do.’ It was a long process, but the book was always on my mind.” While developing the film, Lanthimos and Stone collaborated with each other on the short film Bleat (2022).[8]
				Pre-production
				Poor Things was officially announced in February 2021.[9] Lanthimos felt that working with Stone again gave him an advantage to the production, as they developed a mutual trust towards one another. Stone also discussed how the process of making Poor Things was different in comparison to The Favourite, due to also acting as a producer: “It was so interesting to be involved in how the film was being pieced together, from cast to department heads to what have you. Ultimately, Yorgos was the one making those decisions, but I was very involved in the process, which started during the pandemic; we were reaching out to people and casting and everything during that time, because we couldn’t go anywhere.”[10]

				Premise
				A young woman, Bella, is brought back to life by her guardian, the scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter. Initially naïve, Bella is eager to learn about the world around her, albeit under Baxter's protection. Wanting to see more, she runs off with Duncan Wedderburn, a slick and debauched lawyer, and travels across continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella demands equality and liberation.[7]

				Lanthimos read Poor Things years prior to developing the film and met with the author, Alasdair Gray, in Scotland to acquire the rights. "He was a very lovely man," Lanthimos shared, "Unfortunately, he died just a couple of years before we actually made the film, but he was very special and energetic; he was 80-something [when we met], and as soon as I got there, he had seen Dogtooth and said, 'I had my friend put on the DVD, because I don’t know how to operate these things, but I think you're very talented, young man.'"

				Premise
				A young woman, Bella, is brought back to life by her guardian, the scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter. Initially naïve, Bella is eager to learn about the world around her, albeit under Baxter's protection. Wanting to see more, she runs off with Duncan Wedderburn, a slick and debauched lawyer, and travels across continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella demands equality and liberation.[7]
				Development
				Lanthimos read Poor Things years prior to developing the film and met with the author, Alasdair Gray, in Scotland to acquire the rights. "He was a very lovely man," Lanthimos shared, "Unfortunately, he died just a couple of years before we actually made the film, but he was very special and energetic; he was 80-something [when we met], and as soon as I got there, he had seen Dogtooth and said, 'I had my friend put on the DVD, because I don’t know how to operate these things, but I think you're very talented, young man.'" Lanthimos shared that Gray took him on a personal tour of Glasgow, where Gray showed Lanthimos several places that he had incorporated into the story.[citation needed]
				While filming The Favourite (2018), Lanthimos revisited the project, which he discussed with Emma Stone, who also starred in the film. Lanthimos began developing Poor Things more actively following the success of The Favourite: “After the relative success of The Favourite, where I actually made a slightly more expensive film that was successful, people were more inclined to allow me to do whatever it is that I wanted, so I just went back to Gray’s book and said, ‘This is what I want to do.’ It was a long process, but the book was always on my mind.” While developing the film, Lanthimos and Stone collaborated with each other on the short film Bleat (2022).[8]
				Pre-production
				Poor Things was officially announced in February 2021.[9] Lanthimos felt that working with Stone again gave him an advantage to the production, as they developed a mutual trust towards one another. Stone also discussed how the process of making Poor Things was different in comparison to The Favourite, due to also acting as a producer: “It was so interesting to be involved in how the film was being pieced together, from cast to department heads to what have you. Ultimately, Yorgos was the one making those decisions, but I was very involved in the process, which started during the pandemic; we were reaching out to people and casting and everything during that time, because we couldn’t go anywhere.”[10]

Ultimately, Yorgos was the one making those decisions, but I was very involved in the process, which started during the pandemic; we were reaching out to people and casting and everything during that time, because we couldn’t go anywhere.”[10]

				Premise
				A young woman, Bella, is brought back to life by her guardian, the scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter. Initially naïve, Bella is eager to learn about the world around her, albeit under Baxter's protection. Wanting to see more, she runs off with Duncan Wedderburn, a slick and debauched lawyer, and travels across continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella demands equality and liberation.[7]
				Development
				Lanthimos read Poor Things years prior to developing the film and met with the author, Alasdair Gray, in Scotland to acquire the rights. "He was a very lovely man," Lanthimos shared, "Unfortunately, he died just a couple of years before we actually made the film, but he was very special and energetic; he was 80-something [when we met], and as soon as I got there, he had seen Dogtooth and said, 'I had my friend put on the DVD, because I don’t know how to operate these things, but I think you're very talented, young man.'" Lanthimos shared that Gray took him on a personal tour of Glasgow, where Gray showed Lanthimos several places that he had incorporated into the story.[citation needed]
				While filming The Favourite (2018), Lanthimos revisited the project, which he discussed with Emma Stone, who also starred in the film. Lanthimos began developing Poor Things more actively following the success of The Favourite: “After the relative success of The Favourite, where I actually made a slightly more expensive film that was successful, people were more inclined to allow me to do whatever it is that I wanted, so I just went back to Gray’s book and said, ‘This is what I want to do.’ It was a long process, but the book was always on my mind.” While developing the film, Lanthimos and Stone collaborated with each other on the short film Bleat (2022).[8]

			<cbc:Description languageID="ENG">
				Premise
				A young woman, Bella, is brought back to life by her guardian, the scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter. Initially naïve, Bella is eager to learn about the world around her, albeit under Baxter's protection. Wanting to see more, she runs off with Duncan Wedderburn, a slick and debauched lawyer, and travels across continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella demands equality and liberation.[7]
				Development
				Lanthimos read Poor Things years prior to developing the film and met with the author, Alasdair Gray, in Scotland to acquire the rights. "He was a very lovely man," Lanthimos shared, "Unfortunately, he died just a couple of years before we actually made the film, but he was very special and energetic; he was 80-something [when we met], and as soon as I got there, he had seen Dogtooth and said, 'I had my friend put on the DVD, because I don’t know how to operate these things, but I think you're very talented, young man.'" Lanthimos shared that Gray took him on a personal tour of Glasgow, where Gray showed Lanthimos several places that he had incorporated into the story.[citation needed]
				While filming The Favourite (2018), Lanthimos revisited the project, which he discussed with Emma Stone, who also starred in the film. Lanthimos began developing Poor Things more actively following the success of The Favourite: “After the relative success of The Favourite, where I actually made a slightly more expensive film that was successful, people were more inclined to allow me to do whatever it is that I wanted, so I just went back to Gray’s book and said, ‘This is what I want to do.’ It was a long process, but the book was always on my mind.” While developing the film, Lanthimos and Stone collaborated with each other on the short film Bleat (2022).[8]
				Pre-production
				Poor Things was officially announced in February 2021.[9] Lanthimos felt that working with Stone again gave him an advantage to the production, as they developed a mutual trust towards one another. Stone also discussed how the process of making Poor Things was different in comparison to The Favourite, due to also acting as a producer: “It was so interesting to be involved in how the film was being pieced together, from cast to department heads to what have you. Ultimately, Yorgos was the one making those decisions, but I was very involved in the process, which started during the pandemic; we were reaching out to people and casting and everything during that time, because we couldn’t go anywhere.”[10]

				Premise
				A young woman, Bella, is brought back to life by her guardian, the scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter. Initially naïve, Bella is eager to learn about the world around her, albeit under Baxter's protection. Wanting to see more, she runs off with Duncan Wedderburn, a slick and debauched lawyer, and travels across continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella demands equality and liberation.[7]
				Development
				Lanthimos read Poor Things years prior to developing the film and met with the author, Alasdair Gray, in Scotland to acquire the rights. "He was a very lovely man," Lanthimos shared, "Unfortunately, he died just a couple of years before we actually made the film, but he was very special and energetic; he was 80-something [when we met], and as soon as I got there, he had seen Dogtooth and said, 'I had my friend put on the DVD, because I don’t know how to operate these things, but I think you're very talented, young man.'" Lanthimos shared that Gray took him on a personal tour of Glasgow, where Gray showed Lanthimos several places that he had incorporated into the story.[citation needed]
				While filming The Favourite (2018), Lanthimos revisited the project, which he discussed with Emma Stone, who also starred in the film. Lanthimos began developing Poor Things more actively following the success of The Favourite: “After the relative success of The Favourite, where I actually made a slightly more expensive film that was successful, people were more inclined to allow me to do whatever it is that I wanted, so I just went back to Gray’s book and said, ‘This is what I want to do.’ It was a long process, but the book was always on my mind.” While developing the film, Lanthimos and Stone collaborated with each other on the short film Bleat (2022).[8]
				Pre-production
				Poor Things was officially announced in February 2021.[9] Lanthimos felt that working with Stone again gave him an advantage to the production, as they developed a mutual trust towards one another. Stone also discussed how the process of making Poor Things was different in comparison to The Favourite, due to also acting as a producer: “It was so interesting to be involved in how the film was being pieced together, from cast to department heads to what have you. Ultimately, Yorgos was the one making those decisions, but I was very involved in the process, which started during the pandemic; we were reaching out to people and casting and everything during that time, because we couldn’t go anywhere.”[10]

				A young woman, Bella, is brought back to life by her guardian, the scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter. Initially naïve, Bella is eager to learn about the world around her, albeit under Baxter's protection. Wanting to see more, she runs off with Duncan Wedderburn, a slick and debauched lawyer, and travels across continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella demands equality and liberation.[7]
				Development
				Lanthimos read Poor Things years prior to developing the film and met with the author, Alasdair Gray, in Scotland to acquire the rights. "He was a very lovely man," Lanthimos shared, "Unfortunately, he died just a couple of years before we actually made the film, but he was very special and energetic; he was 80-something [when we met], and as soon as I got there, he had seen Dogtooth and said, 'I had my friend put on the DVD, because I don’t know how to operate these things, but I think you're very talented, young man.'" Lanthimos shared that Gray took him on a personal tour of Glasgow, where Gray showed Lanthimos several places that he had incorporated into the story.[citation needed]
				While filming The Favourite (2018), Lanthimos revisited the project, which he discussed with Emma Stone, who also starred in the film. Lanthimos began developing Poor Things more actively following the success of The Favourite: “After the relative success of The Favourite, where I actually made a slightly more expensive film that was successful, people were more inclined to allow me to do whatever it is that I wanted, so I just went back to Gray’s book and said, ‘This is what I want to do.’ It was a long process, but the book was always on my mind.” While developing the film, Lanthimos and Stone collaborated with each other on the short film Bleat (2022).[8]
				Pre-production
				Poor Things was officially announced in February 2021.[9] Lanthimos felt that working with Stone again gave him an advantage to the production, as they developed a mutual trust towards one another. Stone also discussed how the process of making Poor Things was different in comparison to The Favourite, due to also acting as a producer: “It was so interesting to be involved in how the film was being pieced together, from cast to department heads to what have you. Ultimately, Yorgos was the one making those decisions, but I was very involved in the process, which started during the pandemic; we were reaching out to people and casting and everything during that time, because we couldn’t go anywhere.”[10]

				Premise
				A young woman, Bella, is brought back to life by her guardian, the scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter. Initially naïve, Bella is eager to learn about the world around her, albeit under Baxter's protection. Wanting to see more, she runs off with Duncan Wedderburn, a slick and debauched lawyer, and travels across continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella demands equality and liberation.[7]
				Development
				Lanthimos read Poor Things years prior to developing the film and met with the author, Alasdair Gray, in Scotland to acquire the rights. "He was a very lovely man," Lanthimos shared, "Unfortunately, he died just a couple of years before we actually made the film, but he was very special and energetic; he was 80-something [when we met], and as soon as I got there, he had seen Dogtooth and said, 'I had my friend put on the DVD, because I don’t know how to operate these things, but I think you're very talented, young man.'" Lanthimos shared that Gray took him on a personal tour of Glasgow, where Gray showed Lanthimos several places that he had incorporated into the story.[citation needed]
				While filming The Favourite (2018), Lanthimos revisited the project, which he discussed with Emma Stone, who also starred in the film. Lanthimos began developing Poor Things more actively following the success of The Favourite: “After the relative success of The Favourite, where I actually made a slightly more expensive film that was successful, people were more inclined to allow me to do whatever it is that I wanted, so I just went back to Gray’s book and said, ‘This is what I want to do.’ It was a long process, but the book was always on my mind.” While developing the film, Lanthimos and Stone collaborated with each other on the short film Bleat (2022).[8]
				Pre-production
				Poor Things was officially announced in February 2021.[9] Lanthimos felt that working with Stone again gave him an advantage to the production, as they developed a mutual trust towards one another. Stone also discussed how the process of making Poor Things was different in comparison to The Favourite, due to also acting as a producer: “It was so interesting to be involved in how the film was being pieced together, from cast to department heads to what have you. Ultimately, Yorgos was the one making those decisions, but I was very involved in the process, which started during the pandemic; we were reaching out to people and casting and everything during that time, because we couldn’t go anywhere.”[10]

Lanthimos began developing Poor Things more actively following the success of The Favourite: “After the relative success of The Favourite, where I actually made a slightly more expensive film that was successful, people were more inclined to allow me to do whatever it is that I wanted, so I just went back to Gray’s book and said, ‘This is what I want to do.’ It was a long process, but the book was always on my mind.” While developing the film, Lanthimos and Stone collaborated with each other on the short film Bleat (2022).[8]
				Pre-production
				Poor Things was officially announced in February 2021.[9] Lanthimos felt that working with Stone again gave him an advantage to the production, as they developed a mutual trust towards one another. Stone also discussed how the process of making Poor Things was different in comparison to The Favourite, due to also acting as a producer: “It was so interesting to be involved in how the film was being pieced together, from cast to department heads to what have you. Ultimately, Yorgos was the one making those decisions, but I was very involved in the process, which started during the pandemic; we were reaching out to people and casting and everything during that time, because we couldn’t go anywhere.”[10]

				Premise
				A young woman, Bella, is brought back to life by her guardian, the scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter. Initially naïve, Bella is eager to learn about the world around her, albeit under Baxter's protection. Wanting to see more, she runs off with Duncan Wedderburn, a slick and debauched lawyer, and travels across continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella demands equality and liberation.[7]

"He was a very lovely man," Lanthimos shared, "Unfortunately, he died just a couple of years before we actually made the film, but he was very special and energetic; he was 80-something [when we met], and as soon as I got there, he had seen Dogtooth and said, 'I had my friend put on the DVD, because I don’t know how to operate these things, but I think you're very talented, young man.'"

				Premise
				A young woman, Bella, is brought back to life by her guardian, the scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter. Initially naïve, Bella is eager to learn about the world around her, albeit under Baxter's protection. Wanting to see more, she runs off with Duncan Wedderburn, a slick and debauched lawyer, and travels across continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella demands equality and liberation.[7]
				Development
				Lanthimos read Poor Things years prior to developing the film and met with the author, Alasdair Gray, in Scotland to acquire the rights. "He was a very lovely man," Lanthimos shared, "Unfortunately, he died just a couple of years before we actually made the film, but he was very special and energetic; he was 80-something [when we met], and as soon as I got there, he had seen Dogtooth and said, 'I had my friend put on the DVD, because I don’t know how to operate these things, but I think you're very talented, young man.'" Lanthimos shared that Gray took him on a personal tour of Glasgow, where Gray showed Lanthimos several places that he had incorporated into the story.[citation needed]
				While filming The Favourite (2018), Lanthimos revisited the project, which he discussed with Emma Stone, who also starred in the film. Lanthimos began developing Poor Things more actively following the success of The Favourite: “After the relative success of The Favourite, where I actually made a slightly more expensive film that was successful, people were more inclined to allow me to do whatever it is that I wanted, so I just went back to Gray’s book and said, ‘This is what I want to do.’ It was a long process, but the book was always on my mind.” While developing the film, Lanthimos and Stone collaborated with each other on the short film Bleat (2022).[8]
				Pre-production
				Poor Things was officially announced in February 2021.[9] Lanthimos felt that working with Stone again gave him an advantage to the production, as they developed a mutual trust towards one another. Stone also discussed how the process of making Poor Things was different in comparison to The Favourite, due to also acting as a producer: “It was so interesting to be involved in how the film was being pieced together, from cast to department heads to what have you. Ultimately, Yorgos was the one making those decisions, but I was very involved in the process, which started during the pandemic; we were reaching out to people and casting and everything during that time, because we couldn’t go anywhere.”[10]

Ultimately, Yorgos was the one making those decisions, but I was very involved in the process, which started during the pandemic; we were reaching out to people and casting and everything during that time, because we couldn’t go anywhere.”[10]

				Premise
				A young woman, Bella, is brought back to life by her guardian, the scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter. Initially naïve, Bella is eager to learn about the world around her, albeit under Baxter's protection. Wanting to see more, she runs off with Duncan Wedderburn, a slick and debauched lawyer, and travels across continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella demands equality and liberation.[7]
				Development
				Lanthimos read Poor Things years prior to developing the film and met with the author, Alasdair Gray, in Scotland to acquire the rights. "He was a very lovely man," Lanthimos shared, "Unfortunately, he died just a couple of years before we actually made the film, but he was very special and energetic; he was 80-something [when we met], and as soon as I got there, he had seen Dogtooth and said, 'I had my friend put on the DVD, because I don’t know how to operate these things, but I think you're very talented, young man.'" Lanthimos shared that Gray took him on a personal tour of Glasgow, where Gray showed Lanthimos several places that he had incorporated into the story.[citation needed]
				While filming The Favourite (2018), Lanthimos revisited the project, which he discussed with Emma Stone, who also starred in the film. Lanthimos began developing Poor Things more actively following the success of The Favourite: “After the relative success of The Favourite, where I actually made a slightly more expensive film that was successful, people were more inclined to allow me to do whatever it is that I wanted, so I just went back to Gray’s book and said, ‘This is what I want to do.’ It was a long process, but the book was always on my mind.” While developing the film, Lanthimos and Stone collaborated with each other on the short film Bleat (2022).[8]

			<cbc:Description languageID="ENG">
				Premise
				A young woman, Bella, is brought back to life by her guardian, the scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter. Initially naïve, Bella is eager to learn about the world around her, albeit under Baxter's protection. Wanting to see more, she runs off with Duncan Wedderburn, a slick and debauched lawyer, and travels across continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella demands equality and liberation.[7]
				Development
				Lanthimos read Poor Things years prior to developing the film and met with the author, Alasdair Gray, in Scotland to acquire the rights. "He was a very lovely man," Lanthimos shared, "Unfortunately, he died just a couple of years before we actually made the film, but he was very special and energetic; he was 80-something [when we met], and as soon as I got there, he had seen Dogtooth and said, 'I had my friend put on the DVD, because I don’t know how to operate these things, but I think you're very talented, young man.'" Lanthimos shared that Gray took him on a personal tour of Glasgow, where Gray showed Lanthimos several places that he had incorporated into the story.[citation needed]
				While filming The Favourite (2018), Lanthimos revisited the project, which he discussed with Emma Stone, who also starred in the film. Lanthimos began developing Poor Things more actively following the success of The Favourite: “After the relative success of The Favourite, where I actually made a slightly more expensive film that was successful, people were more inclined to allow me to do whatever it is that I wanted, so I just went back to Gray’s book and said, ‘This is what I want to do.’ It was a long process, but the book was always on my mind.” While developing the film, Lanthimos and Stone collaborated with each other on the short film Bleat (2022).[8]
				Pre-production
				Poor Things was officially announced in February 2021.[9] Lanthimos felt that working with Stone again gave him an advantage to the production, as they developed a mutual trust towards one another. Stone also discussed how the process of making Poor Things was different in comparison to The Favourite, due to also acting as a producer: “It was so interesting to be involved in how the film was being pieced together, from cast to department heads to what have you. Ultimately, Yorgos was the one making those decisions, but I was very involved in the process, which started during the pandemic; we were reaching out to people and casting and everything during that time, because we couldn’t go anywhere.”[10]

			<cbc:Description languageID="ENG">
				Premise
				A young woman, Bella, is brought back to life by her guardian, the scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter. Initially naïve, Bella is eager to learn about the world around her, albeit under Baxter's protection. Wanting to see more, she runs off with Duncan Wedderburn, a slick and debauched lawyer, and travels across continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella demands equality and liberation.[7]
				Development
				Lanthimos read Poor Things years prior to developing the film and met with the author, Alasdair Gray, in Scotland to acquire the rights. "He was a very lovely man," Lanthimos shared, "Unfortunately, he died just a couple of years before we actually made the film, but he was very special and energetic; he was 80-something [when we met], and as soon as I got there, he had seen Dogtooth and said, 'I had my friend put on the DVD, because I don’t know how to operate these things, but I think you're very talented, young man.'" Lanthimos shared that Gray took him on a personal tour of Glasgow, where Gray showed Lanthimos several places that he had incorporated into the story.[citation needed]
				While filming The Favourite (2018), Lanthimos revisited the project, which he discussed with Emma Stone, who also starred in the film. Lanthimos began developing Poor Things more actively following the success of The Favourite: “After the relative success of The Favourite, where I actually made a slightly more expensive film that was successful, people were more inclined to allow me to do whatever it is that I wanted, so I just went back to Gray’s book and said, ‘This is what I want to do.’ It was a long process, but the book was always on my mind.” While developing the film, Lanthimos and Stone collaborated with each other on the short film Bleat (2022).[8]
				Pre-production
				Poor Things was officially announced in February 2021.[9] Lanthimos felt that working with Stone again gave him an advantage to the production, as they developed a mutual trust towards one another. Stone also discussed how the process of making Poor Things was different in comparison to The Favourite, due to also acting as a producer: “It was so interesting to be involved in how the film was being pieced together, from cast to department heads to what have you. Ultimately, Yorgos was the one making those decisions, but I was very involved in the process, which started during the pandemic; we were reaching out to people and casting and everything during that time, because we couldn’t go anywhere.”[10]

				A young woman, Bella, is brought back to life by her guardian, the scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter. Initially naïve, Bella is eager to learn about the world around her, albeit under Baxter's protection. Wanting to see more, she runs off with Duncan Wedderburn, a slick and debauched lawyer, and travels across continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella demands equality and liberation.[7]
				Development
				Lanthimos read Poor Things years prior to developing the film and met with the author, Alasdair Gray, in Scotland to acquire the rights. "He was a very lovely man," Lanthimos shared, "Unfortunately, he died just a couple of years before we actually made the film, but he was very special and energetic; he was 80-something [when we met], and as soon as I got there, he had seen Dogtooth and said, 'I had my friend put on the DVD, because I don’t know how to operate these things, but I think you're very talented, young man.'" Lanthimos shared that Gray took him on a personal tour of Glasgow, where Gray showed Lanthimos several places that he had incorporated into the story.[citation needed]
				While filming The Favourite (2018), Lanthimos revisited the project, which he discussed with Emma Stone, who also starred in the film. Lanthimos began developing Poor Things more actively following the success of The Favourite: “After the relative success of The Favourite, where I actually made a slightly more expensive film that was successful, people were more inclined to allow me to do whatever it is that I wanted, so I just went back to Gray’s book and said, ‘This is what I want to do.’ It was a long process, but the book was always on my mind.” While developing the film, Lanthimos and Stone collaborated with each other on the short film Bleat (2022).[8]
				Pre-production
				Poor Things was officially announced in February 2021.[9] Lanthimos felt that working with Stone again gave him an advantage to the production, as they developed a mutual trust towards one another. Stone also discussed how the process of making Poor Things was different in comparison to The Favourite, due to also acting as a producer: “It was so interesting to be involved in how the film was being pieced together, from cast to department heads to what have you. Ultimately, Yorgos was the one making those decisions, but I was very involved in the process, which started during the pandemic; we were reaching out to people and casting and everything during that time, because we couldn’t go anywhere.”[10]

				Premise
				A young woman, Bella, is brought back to life by her guardian, the scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter. Initially naïve, Bella is eager to learn about the world around her, albeit under Baxter's protection. Wanting to see more, she runs off with Duncan Wedderburn, a slick and debauched lawyer, and travels across continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella demands equality and liberation.[7]
				Development
				Lanthimos read Poor Things years prior to developing the film and met with the author, Alasdair Gray, in Scotland to acquire the rights. "He was a very lovely man," Lanthimos shared, "Unfortunately, he died just a couple of years before we actually made the film, but he was very special and energetic; he was 80-something [when we met], and as soon as I got there, he had seen Dogtooth and said, 'I had my friend put on the DVD, because I don’t know how to operate these things, but I think you're very talented, young man.'" Lanthimos shared that Gray took him on a personal tour of Glasgow, where Gray showed Lanthimos several places that he had incorporated into the story.[citation needed]
				While filming The Favourite (2018), Lanthimos revisited the project, which he discussed with Emma Stone, who also starred in the film. Lanthimos began developing Poor Things more actively following the success of The Favourite: “After the relative success of The Favourite, where I actually made a slightly more expensive film that was successful, people were more inclined to allow me to do whatever it is that I wanted, so I just went back to Gray’s book and said, ‘This is what I want to do.’ It was a long process, but the book was always on my mind.” While developing the film, Lanthimos and Stone collaborated with each other on the short film Bleat (2022).[8]
				Pre-production
				Poor Things was officially announced in February 2021.[9] Lanthimos felt that working with Stone again gave him an advantage to the production, as they developed a mutual trust towards one another. Stone also discussed how the process of making Poor Things was different in comparison to The Favourite, due to also acting as a producer: “It was so interesting to be involved in how the film was being pieced together, from cast to department heads to what have you. Ultimately, Yorgos was the one making those decisions, but I was very involved in the process, which started during the pandemic; we were reaching out to people and casting and everything during that time, because we couldn’t go anywhere.”[10]

Lanthimos began developing Poor Things more actively following the success of The Favourite: “After the relative success of The Favourite, where I actually made a slightly more expensive film that was successful, people were more inclined to allow me to do whatever it is that I wanted, so I just went back to Gray’s book and said, ‘This is what I want to do.’ It was a long process, but the book was always on my mind.” While developing the film, Lanthimos and Stone collaborated with each other on the short film Bleat (2022).[8]
				Pre-production
				Poor Things was officially announced in February 2021.[9] Lanthimos felt that working with Stone again gave him an advantage to the production, as they developed a mutual trust towards one another. Stone also discussed how the process of making Poor Things was different in comparison to The Favourite, due to also acting as a producer: “It was so interesting to be involved in how the film was being pieced together, from cast to department heads to what have you. Ultimately, Yorgos was the one making those decisions, but I was very involved in the process, which started during the pandemic; we were reaching out to people and casting and everything during that time, because we couldn’t go anywhere.”[10]

				Premise
				A young woman, Bella, is brought back to life by her guardian, the scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter. Initially naïve, Bella is eager to learn about the world around her, albeit under Baxter's protection. Wanting to see more, she runs off with Duncan Wedderburn, a slick and debauched lawyer, and travels across continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella demands equality and liberation.[7]

"He was a very lovely man," Lanthimos shared, "Unfortunately, he died just a couple of years before we actually made the film, but he was very special and energetic; he was 80-something [when we met], and as soon as I got there, he had seen Dogtooth and said, 'I had my friend put on the DVD, because I don’t know how to operate these things, but I think you're very talented, young man.'"

				Premise
				A young woman, Bella, is brought back to life by her guardian, the scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter. Initially naïve, Bella is eager to learn about the world around her, albeit under Baxter's protection. Wanting to see more, she runs off with Duncan Wedderburn, a slick and debauched lawyer, and travels across continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella demands equality and liberation.[7]
				Development
				Lanthimos read Poor Things years prior to developing the film and met with the author, Alasdair Gray, in Scotland to acquire the rights. "He was a very lovely man," Lanthimos shared, "Unfortunately, he died just a couple of years before we actually made the film, but he was very special and energetic; he was 80-something [when we met], and as soon as I got there, he had seen Dogtooth and said, 'I had my friend put on the DVD, because I don’t know how to operate these things, but I think you're very talented, young man.'" Lanthimos shared that Gray took him on a personal tour of Glasgow, where Gray showed Lanthimos several places that he had incorporated into the story.[citation needed]
				While filming The Favourite (2018), Lanthimos revisited the project, which he discussed with Emma Stone, who also starred in the film. Lanthimos began developing Poor Things more actively following the success of The Favourite: “After the relative success of The Favourite, where I actually made a slightly more expensive film that was successful, people were more inclined to allow me to do whatever it is that I wanted, so I just went back to Gray’s book and said, ‘This is what I want to do.’ It was a long process, but the book was always on my mind.” While developing the film, Lanthimos and Stone collaborated with each other on the short film Bleat (2022).[8]
				Pre-production
				Poor Things was officially announced in February 2021.[9] Lanthimos felt that working with Stone again gave him an advantage to the production, as they developed a mutual trust towards one another. Stone also discussed how the process of making Poor Things was different in comparison to The Favourite, due to also acting as a producer: “It was so interesting to be involved in how the film was being pieced together, from cast to department heads to what have you. Ultimately, Yorgos was the one making those decisions, but I was very involved in the process, which started during the pandemic; we were reaching out to people and casting and everything during that time, because we couldn’t go anywhere.”[10]

Ultimately, Yorgos was the one making those decisions, but I was very involved in the process, which started during the pandemic; we were reaching out to people and casting and everything during that time, because we couldn’t go anywhere.”[10]

				Premise
				A young woman, Bella, is brought back to life by her guardian, the scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter. Initially naïve, Bella is eager to learn about the world around her, albeit under Baxter's protection. Wanting to see more, she runs off with Duncan Wedderburn, a slick and debauched lawyer, and travels across continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella demands equality and liberation.[7]
				Development
				Lanthimos read Poor Things years prior to developing the film and met with the author, Alasdair Gray, in Scotland to acquire the rights. "He was a very lovely man," Lanthimos shared, "Unfortunately, he died just a couple of years before we actually made the film, but he was very special and energetic; he was 80-something [when we met], and as soon as I got there, he had seen Dogtooth and said, 'I had my friend put on the DVD, because I don’t know how to operate these things, but I think you're very talented, young man.'" Lanthimos shared that Gray took him on a personal tour of Glasgow, where Gray showed Lanthimos several places that he had incorporated into the story.[citation needed]
				While filming The Favourite (2018), Lanthimos revisited the project, which he discussed with Emma Stone, who also starred in the film. Lanthimos began developing Poor Things more actively following the success of The Favourite: “After the relative success of The Favourite, where I actually made a slightly more expensive film that was successful, people were more inclined to allow me to do whatever it is that I wanted, so I just went back to Gray’s book and said, ‘This is what I want to do.’ It was a long process, but the book was always on my mind.” While developing the film, Lanthimos and Stone collaborated with each other on the short film Bleat (2022).[8]

				Premise
				A young woman, Bella, is brought back to life by her guardian, the scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter. Initially naïve, Bella is eager to learn about the world around her, albeit under Baxter's protection. Wanting to see more, she runs off with Duncan Wedderburn, a slick and debauched lawyer, and travels across continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella demands equality and liberation.[7]
				Development
				Lanthimos read Poor Things years prior to developing the film and met with the author, Alasdair Gray, in Scotland to acquire the rights. "He was a very lovely man," Lanthimos shared, "Unfortunately, he died just a couple of years before we actually made the film, but he was very special and energetic; he was 80-something [when we met], and as soon as I got there, he had seen Dogtooth and said, 'I had my friend put on the DVD, because I don’t know how to operate these things, but I think you're very talented, young man.'" Lanthimos shared that Gray took him on a personal tour of Glasgow, where Gray showed Lanthimos several places that he had incorporated into the story.[citation needed]
				While filming The Favourite (2018), Lanthimos revisited the project, which he discussed with Emma Stone, who also starred in the film. Lanthimos began developing Poor Things more actively following the success of The Favourite: “After the relative success of The Favourite, where I actually made a slightly more expensive film that was successful, people were more inclined to allow me to do whatever it is that I wanted, so I just went back to Gray’s book and said, ‘This is what I want to do.’ It was a long process, but the book was always on my mind.” While developing the film, Lanthimos and Stone collaborated with each other on the short film Bleat (2022).[8]
				Pre-production
				Poor Things was officially announced in February 2021.[9] Lanthimos felt that working with Stone again gave him an advantage to the production, as they developed a mutual trust towards one another. Stone also discussed how the process of making Poor Things was different in comparison to The Favourite, due to also acting as a producer: “It was so interesting to be involved in how the film was being pieced together, from cast to department heads to what have you. Ultimately, Yorgos was the one making those decisions, but I was very involved in the process, which started during the pandemic; we were reaching out to people and casting and everything during that time, because we couldn’t go anywhere.”[10]

				Premise
				A young woman, Bella, is brought back to life by her guardian, the scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter. Initially naïve, Bella is eager to learn about the world around her, albeit under Baxter's protection. Wanting to see more, she runs off with Duncan Wedderburn, a slick and debauched lawyer, and travels across continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella demands equality and liberation.[7]
				Development
				Lanthimos read Poor Things years prior to developing the film and met with the author, Alasdair Gray, in Scotland to acquire the rights. "He was a very lovely man," Lanthimos shared, "Unfortunately, he died just a couple of years before we actually made the film, but he was very special and energetic; he was 80-something [when we met], and as soon as I got there, he had seen Dogtooth and said, 'I had my friend put on the DVD, because I don’t know how to operate these things, but I think you're very talented, young man.'" Lanthimos shared that Gray took him on a personal tour of Glasgow, where Gray showed Lanthimos several places that he had incorporated into the story.[citation needed]
				While filming The Favourite (2018), Lanthimos revisited the project, which he discussed with Emma Stone, who also starred in the film. Lanthimos began developing Poor Things more actively following the success of The Favourite: “After the relative success of The Favourite, where I actually made a slightly more expensive film that was successful, people were more inclined to allow me to do whatever it is that I wanted, so I just went back to Gray’s book and said, ‘This is what I want to do.’ It was a long process, but the book was always on my mind.” While developing the film, Lanthimos and Stone collaborated with each other on the short film Bleat (2022).[8]
				Pre-production
				Poor Things was officially announced in February 2021.[9] Lanthimos felt that working with Stone again gave him an advantage to the production, as they developed a mutual trust towards one another. Stone also discussed how the process of making Poor Things was different in comparison to The Favourite, due to also acting as a producer: “It was so interesting to be involved in how the film was being pieced together, from cast to department heads to what have you. Ultimately, Yorgos was the one making those decisions, but I was very involved in the process, which started during the pandemic; we were reaching out to people and casting and everything during that time, because we couldn’t go anywhere.”[10]

				A young woman, Bella, is brought back to life by her guardian, the scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter. Initially naïve, Bella is eager to learn about the world around her, albeit under Baxter's protection. Wanting to see more, she runs off with Duncan Wedderburn, a slick and debauched lawyer, and travels across continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella demands equality and liberation.[7]
				Development
				Lanthimos read Poor Things years prior to developing the film and met with the author, Alasdair Gray, in Scotland to acquire the rights. "He was a very lovely man," Lanthimos shared, "Unfortunately, he died just a couple of years before we actually made the film, but he was very special and energetic; he was 80-something [when we met], and as soon as I got there, he had seen Dogtooth and said, 'I had my friend put on the DVD, because I don’t know how to operate these things, but I think you're very talented, young man.'" Lanthimos shared that Gray took him on a personal tour of Glasgow, where Gray showed Lanthimos several places that he had incorporated into the story.[citation needed]
				While filming The Favourite (2018), Lanthimos revisited the project, which he discussed with Emma Stone, who also starred in the film. Lanthimos began developing Poor Things more actively following the success of The Favourite: “After the relative success of The Favourite, where I actually made a slightly more expensive film that was successful, people were more inclined to allow me to do whatever it is that I wanted, so I just went back to Gray’s book and said, ‘This is what I want to do.’ It was a long process, but the book was always on my mind.” While developing the film, Lanthimos and Stone collaborated with each other on the short film Bleat (2022).[8]
				Pre-production
				Poor Things was officially announced in February 2021.[9] Lanthimos felt that working with Stone again gave him an advantage to the production, as they developed a mutual trust towards one another. Stone also discussed how the process of making Poor Things was different in comparison to The Favourite, due to also acting as a producer: “It was so interesting to be involved in how the film was being pieced together, from cast to department heads to what have you. Ultimately, Yorgos was the one making those decisions, but I was very involved in the process, which started during the pandemic; we were reaching out to people and casting and everything during that time, because we couldn’t go anywhere.”[10]

				Premise
				A young woman, Bella, is brought back to life by her guardian, the scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter. Initially naïve, Bella is eager to learn about the world around her, albeit under Baxter's protection. Wanting to see more, she runs off with Duncan Wedderburn, a slick and debauched lawyer, and travels across continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella demands equality and liberation.[7]
				Development
				Lanthimos read Poor Things years prior to developing the film and met with the author, Alasdair Gray, in Scotland to acquire the rights. "He was a very lovely man," Lanthimos shared, "Unfortunately, he died just a couple of years before we actually made the film, but he was very special and energetic; he was 80-something [when we met], and as soon as I got there, he had seen Dogtooth and said, 'I had my friend put on the DVD, because I don’t know how to operate these things, but I think you're very talented, young man.'" Lanthimos shared that Gray took him on a personal tour of Glasgow, where Gray showed Lanthimos several places that he had incorporated into the story.[citation needed]
				While filming The Favourite (2018), Lanthimos revisited the project, which he discussed with Emma Stone, who also starred in the film. Lanthimos began developing Poor Things more actively following the success of The Favourite: “After the relative success of The Favourite, where I actually made a slightly more expensive film that was successful, people were more inclined to allow me to do whatever it is that I wanted, so I just went back to Gray’s book and said, ‘This is what I want to do.’ It was a long process, but the book was always on my mind.” While developing the film, Lanthimos and Stone collaborated with each other on the short film Bleat (2022).[8]
				Pre-production
				Poor Things was officially announced in February 2021.[9] Lanthimos felt that working with Stone again gave him an advantage to the production, as they developed a mutual trust towards one another. Stone also discussed how the process of making Poor Things was different in comparison to The Favourite, due to also acting as a producer: “It was so interesting to be involved in how the film was being pieced together, from cast to department heads to what have you. Ultimately, Yorgos was the one making those decisions, but I was very involved in the process, which started during the pandemic; we were reaching out to people and casting and everything during that time, because we couldn’t go anywhere.”[10]

Lanthimos began developing Poor Things more actively following the success of The Favourite: “After the relative success of The Favourite, where I actually made a slightly more expensive film that was successful, people were more inclined to allow me to do whatever it is that I wanted, so I just went back to Gray’s book and said, ‘This is what I want to do.’ It was a long process, but the book was always on my mind.” While developing the film, Lanthimos and Stone collaborated with each other on the short film Bleat (2022).[8]
				Pre-production
				Poor Things was officially announced in February 2021.[9] Lanthimos felt that working with Stone again gave him an advantage to the production, as they developed a mutual trust towards one another. Stone also discussed how the process of making Poor Things was different in comparison to The Favourite, due to also acting as a producer: “It was so interesting to be involved in how the film was being pieced together, from cast to department heads to what have you. Ultimately, Yorgos was the one making those decisions, but I was very involved in the process, which started during the pandemic; we were reaching out to people and casting and everything during that time, because we couldn’t go anywhere.”[10]

				Premise
				A young woman, Bella, is brought back to life by her guardian, the scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter. Initially naïve, Bella is eager to learn about the world around her, albeit under Baxter's protection. Wanting to see more, she runs off with Duncan Wedderburn, a slick and debauched lawyer, and travels across continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella demands equality and liberation.[7]

"He was a very lovely man," Lanthimos shared, "Unfortunately, he died just a couple of years before we actually made the film, but he was very special and energetic; he was 80-something [when we met], and as soon as I got there, he had seen Dogtooth and said, 'I had my friend put on the DVD, because I don’t know how to operate these things, but I think you're very talented, young man.'"

				Premise
				A young woman, Bella, is brought back to life by her guardian, the scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter. Initially naïve, Bella is eager to learn about the world around her, albeit under Baxter's protection. Wanting to see more, she runs off with Duncan Wedderburn, a slick and debauched lawyer, and travels across continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella demands equality and liberation.[7]
				Development
				Lanthimos read Poor Things years prior to developing the film and met with the author, Alasdair Gray, in Scotland to acquire the rights. "He was a very lovely man," Lanthimos shared, "Unfortunately, he died just a couple of years before we actually made the film, but he was very special and energetic; he was 80-something [when we met], and as soon as I got there, he had seen Dogtooth and said, 'I had my friend put on the DVD, because I don’t know how to operate these things, but I think you're very talented, young man.'" Lanthimos shared that Gray took him on a personal tour of Glasgow, where Gray showed Lanthimos several places that he had incorporated into the story.[citation needed]
				While filming The Favourite (2018), Lanthimos revisited the project, which he discussed with Emma Stone, who also starred in the film. Lanthimos began developing Poor Things more actively following the success of The Favourite: “After the relative success of The Favourite, where I actually made a slightly more expensive film that was successful, people were more inclined to allow me to do whatever it is that I wanted, so I just went back to Gray’s book and said, ‘This is what I want to do.’ It was a long process, but the book was always on my mind.” While developing the film, Lanthimos and Stone collaborated with each other on the short film Bleat (2022).[8]
				Pre-production
				Poor Things was officially announced in February 2021.[9] Lanthimos felt that working with Stone again gave him an advantage to the production, as they developed a mutual trust towards one another. Stone also discussed how the process of making Poor Things was different in comparison to The Favourite, due to also acting as a producer: “It was so interesting to be involved in how the film was being pieced together, from cast to department heads to what have you. Ultimately, Yorgos was the one making those decisions, but I was very involved in the process, which started during the pandemic; we were reaching out to people and casting and everything during that time, because we couldn’t go anywhere.”[10]

Ultimately, Yorgos was the one making those decisions, but I was very involved in the process, which started during the pandemic; we were reaching out to people and casting and everything during that time, because we couldn’t go anywhere.”[10]

				Premise
				A young woman, Bella, is brought back to life by her guardian, the scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter. Initially naïve, Bella is eager to learn about the world around her, albeit under Baxter's protection. Wanting to see more, she runs off with Duncan Wedderburn, a slick and debauched lawyer, and travels across continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella demands equality and liberation.[7]
				Development
				Lanthimos read Poor Things years prior to developing the film and met with the author, Alasdair Gray, in Scotland to acquire the rights. "He was a very lovely man," Lanthimos shared, "Unfortunately, he died just a couple of years before we actually made the film, but he was very special and energetic; he was 80-something [when we met], and as soon as I got there, he had seen Dogtooth and said, 'I had my friend put on the DVD, because I don’t know how to operate these things, but I think you're very talented, young man.'" Lanthimos shared that Gray took him on a personal tour of Glasgow, where Gray showed Lanthimos several places that he had incorporated into the story.[citation needed]
				While filming The Favourite (2018), Lanthimos revisited the project, which he discussed with Emma Stone, who also starred in the film. Lanthimos began developing Poor Things more actively following the success of The Favourite: “After the relative success of The Favourite, where I actually made a slightly more expensive film that was successful, people were more inclined to allow me to do whatever it is that I wanted, so I just went back to Gray’s book and said, ‘This is what I want to do.’ It was a long process, but the book was always on my mind.” While developing the film, Lanthimos and Stone collaborated with each other on the short film Bleat (2022).[8]

			<cbc:Description languageID="ENG">
				Premise
				A young woman, Bella, is brought back to life by her guardian, the scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter. Initially naïve, Bella is eager to learn about the world around her, albeit under Baxter's protection. Wanting to see more, she runs off with Duncan Wedderburn, a slick and debauched lawyer, and travels across continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella demands equality and liberation.[7]
				Development
				Lanthimos read Poor Things years prior to developing the film and met with the author, Alasdair Gray, in Scotland to acquire the rights. "He was a very lovely man," Lanthimos shared, "Unfortunately, he died just a couple of years before we actually made the film, but he was very special and energetic; he was 80-something [when we met], and as soon as I got there, he had seen Dogtooth and said, 'I had my friend put on the DVD, because I don’t know how to operate these things, but I think you're very talented, young man.'" Lanthimos shared that Gray took him on a personal tour of Glasgow, where Gray showed Lanthimos several places that he had incorporated into the story.[citation needed]
				While filming The Favourite (2018), Lanthimos revisited the project, which he discussed with Emma Stone, who also starred in the film. Lanthimos began developing Poor Things more actively following the success of The Favourite: “After the relative success of The Favourite, where I actually made a slightly more expensive film that was successful, people were more inclined to allow me to do whatever it is that I wanted, so I just went back to Gray’s book and said, ‘This is what I want to do.’ It was a long process, but the book was always on my mind.” While developing the film, Lanthimos and Stone collaborated with each other on the short film Bleat (2022).[8]
				Pre-production
				Poor Things was officially announced in February 2021.[9] Lanthimos felt that working with Stone again gave him an advantage to the production, as they developed a mutual trust towards one another. Stone also discussed how the process of making Poor Things was different in comparison to The Favourite, due to also acting as a producer: “It was so interesting to be involved in how the film was being pieced together, from cast to department heads to what have you. Ultimately, Yorgos was the one making those decisions, but I was very involved in the process, which started during the pandemic; we were reaching out to people and casting and everything during that time, because we couldn’t go anywhere.”[10]

				Premise
				A young woman, Bella, is brought back to life by her guardian, the scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter. Initially naïve, Bella is eager to learn about the world around her, albeit under Baxter's protection. Wanting to see more, she runs off with Duncan Wedderburn, a slick and debauched lawyer, and travels across continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella demands equality and liberation.[7]
				Development
				Lanthimos read Poor Things years prior to developing the film and met with the author, Alasdair Gray, in Scotland to acquire the rights. "He was a very lovely man," Lanthimos shared, "Unfortunately, he died just a couple of years before we actually made the film, but he was very special and energetic; he was 80-something [when we met], and as soon as I got there, he had seen Dogtooth and said, 'I had my friend put on the DVD, because I don’t know how to operate these things, but I think you're very talented, young man.'" Lanthimos shared that Gray took him on a personal tour of Glasgow, where Gray showed Lanthimos several places that he had incorporated into the story.[citation needed]
				While filming The Favourite (2018), Lanthimos revisited the project, which he discussed with Emma Stone, who also starred in the film. Lanthimos began developing Poor Things more actively following the success of The Favourite: “After the relative success of The Favourite, where I actually made a slightly more expensive film that was successful, people were more inclined to allow me to do whatever it is that I wanted, so I just went back to Gray’s book and said, ‘This is what I want to do.’ It was a long process, but the book was always on my mind.” While developing the film, Lanthimos and Stone collaborated with each other on the short film Bleat (2022).[8]
				Pre-production
				Poor Things was officially announced in February 2021.[9] Lanthimos felt that working with Stone again gave him an advantage to the production, as they developed a mutual trust towards one another. Stone also discussed how the process of making Poor Things was different in comparison to The Favourite, due to also acting as a producer: “It was so interesting to be involved in how the film was being pieced together, from cast to department heads to what have you. Ultimately, Yorgos was the one making those decisions, but I was very involved in the process, which started during the pandemic; we were reaching out to people and casting and everything during that time, because we couldn’t go anywhere.”[10]

				A young woman, Bella, is brought back to life by her guardian, the scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter. Initially naïve, Bella is eager to learn about the world around her, albeit under Baxter's protection. Wanting to see more, she runs off with Duncan Wedderburn, a slick and debauched lawyer, and travels across continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella demands equality and liberation.[7]
				Development
				Lanthimos read Poor Things years prior to developing the film and met with the author, Alasdair Gray, in Scotland to acquire the rights. "He was a very lovely man," Lanthimos shared, "Unfortunately, he died just a couple of years before we actually made the film, but he was very special and energetic; he was 80-something [when we met], and as soon as I got there, he had seen Dogtooth and said, 'I had my friend put on the DVD, because I don’t know how to operate these things, but I think you're very talented, young man.'" Lanthimos shared that Gray took him on a personal tour of Glasgow, where Gray showed Lanthimos several places that he had incorporated into the story.[citation needed]
				While filming The Favourite (2018), Lanthimos revisited the project, which he discussed with Emma Stone, who also starred in the film. Lanthimos began developing Poor Things more actively following the success of The Favourite: “After the relative success of The Favourite, where I actually made a slightly more expensive film that was successful, people were more inclined to allow me to do whatever it is that I wanted, so I just went back to Gray’s book and said, ‘This is what I want to do.’ It was a long process, but the book was always on my mind.” While developing the film, Lanthimos and Stone collaborated with each other on the short film Bleat (2022).[8]
				Pre-production
				Poor Things was officially announced in February 2021.[9] Lanthimos felt that working with Stone again gave him an advantage to the production, as they developed a mutual trust towards one another. Stone also discussed how the process of making Poor Things was different in comparison to The Favourite, due to also acting as a producer: “It was so interesting to be involved in how the film was being pieced together, from cast to department heads to what have you. Ultimately, Yorgos was the one making those decisions, but I was very involved in the process, which started during the pandemic; we were reaching out to people and casting and everything during that time, because we couldn’t go anywhere.”[10]

				Premise
				A young woman, Bella, is brought back to life by her guardian, the scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter. Initially naïve, Bella is eager to learn about the world around her, albeit under Baxter's protection. Wanting to see more, she runs off with Duncan Wedderburn, a slick and debauched lawyer, and travels across continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella demands equality and liberation.[7]
				Development
				Lanthimos read Poor Things years prior to developing the film and met with the author, Alasdair Gray, in Scotland to acquire the rights. "He was a very lovely man," Lanthimos shared, "Unfortunately, he died just a couple of years before we actually made the film, but he was very special and energetic; he was 80-something [when we met], and as soon as I got there, he had seen Dogtooth and said, 'I had my friend put on the DVD, because I don’t know how to operate these things, but I think you're very talented, young man.'" Lanthimos shared that Gray took him on a personal tour of Glasgow, where Gray showed Lanthimos several places that he had incorporated into the story.[citation needed]
				While filming The Favourite (2018), Lanthimos revisited the project, which he discussed with Emma Stone, who also starred in the film. Lanthimos began developing Poor Things more actively following the success of The Favourite: “After the relative success of The Favourite, where I actually made a slightly more expensive film that was successful, people were more inclined to allow me to do whatever it is that I wanted, so I just went back to Gray’s book and said, ‘This is what I want to do.’ It was a long process, but the book was always on my mind.” While developing the film, Lanthimos and Stone collaborated with each other on the short film Bleat (2022).[8]
				Pre-production
				Poor Things was officially announced in February 2021.[9] Lanthimos felt that working with Stone again gave him an advantage to the production, as they developed a mutual trust towards one another. Stone also discussed how the process of making Poor Things was different in comparison to The Favourite, due to also acting as a producer: “It was so interesting to be involved in how the film was being pieced together, from cast to department heads to what have you. Ultimately, Yorgos was the one making those decisions, but I was very involved in the process, which started during the pandemic; we were reaching out to people and casting and everything during that time, because we couldn’t go anywhere.”[10]

Lanthimos began developing Poor Things more actively following the success of The Favourite: “After the relative success of The Favourite, where I actually made a slightly more expensive film that was successful, people were more inclined to allow me to do whatever it is that I wanted, so I just went back to Gray’s book and said, ‘This is what I want to do.’ It was a long process, but the book was always on my mind.” While developing the film, Lanthimos and Stone collaborated with each other on the short film Bleat (2022).[8]
				Pre-production
				Poor Things was officially announced in February 2021.[9] Lanthimos felt that working with Stone again gave him an advantage to the production, as they developed a mutual trust towards one another. Stone also discussed how the process of making Poor Things was different in comparison to The Favourite, due to also acting as a producer: “It was so interesting to be involved in how the film was being pieced together, from cast to department heads to what have you. Ultimately, Yorgos was the one making those decisions, but I was very involved in the process, which started during the pandemic; we were reaching out to people and casting and everything during that time, because we couldn’t go anywhere.”[10]

				Premise
				A young woman, Bella, is brought back to life by her guardian, the scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter. Initially naïve, Bella is eager to learn about the world around her, albeit under Baxter's protection. Wanting to see more, she runs off with Duncan Wedderburn, a slick and debauched lawyer, and travels across continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella demands equality and liberation.[7]

"He was a very lovely man," Lanthimos shared, "Unfortunately, he died just a couple of years before we actually made the film, but he was very special and energetic; he was 80-something [when we met], and as soon as I got there, he had seen Dogtooth and said, 'I had my friend put on the DVD, because I don’t know how to operate these things, but I think you're very talented, young man.'"

				Premise
				A young woman, Bella, is brought back to life by her guardian, the scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter. Initially naïve, Bella is eager to learn about the world around her, albeit under Baxter's protection. Wanting to see more, she runs off with Duncan Wedderburn, a slick and debauched lawyer, and travels across continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella demands equality and liberation.[7]
				Development
				Lanthimos read Poor Things years prior to developing the film and met with the author, Alasdair Gray, in Scotland to acquire the rights. "He was a very lovely man," Lanthimos shared, "Unfortunately, he died just a couple of years before we actually made the film, but he was very special and energetic; he was 80-something [when we met], and as soon as I got there, he had seen Dogtooth and said, 'I had my friend put on the DVD, because I don’t know how to operate these things, but I think you're very talented, young man.'" Lanthimos shared that Gray took him on a personal tour of Glasgow, where Gray showed Lanthimos several places that he had incorporated into the story.[citation needed]
				While filming The Favourite (2018), Lanthimos revisited the project, which he discussed with Emma Stone, who also starred in the film. Lanthimos began developing Poor Things more actively following the success of The Favourite: “After the relative success of The Favourite, where I actually made a slightly more expensive film that was successful, people were more inclined to allow me to do whatever it is that I wanted, so I just went back to Gray’s book and said, ‘This is what I want to do.’ It was a long process, but the book was always on my mind.” While developing the film, Lanthimos and Stone collaborated with each other on the short film Bleat (2022).[8]
				Pre-production
				Poor Things was officially announced in February 2021.[9] Lanthimos felt that working with Stone again gave him an advantage to the production, as they developed a mutual trust towards one another. Stone also discussed how the process of making Poor Things was different in comparison to The Favourite, due to also acting as a producer: “It was so interesting to be involved in how the film was being pieced together, from cast to department heads to what have you. Ultimately, Yorgos was the one making those decisions, but I was very involved in the process, which started during the pandemic; we were reaching out to people and casting and everything during that time, because we couldn’t go anywhere.”[10]

Ultimately, Yorgos was the one making those decisions, but I was very involved in the process, which started during the pandemic; we were reaching out to people and casting and everything during that time, because we couldn’t go anywhere.”[10]

				Premise
				A young woman, Bella, is brought back to life by her guardian, the scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter. Initially naïve, Bella is eager to learn about the world around her, albeit under Baxter's protection. Wanting to see more, she runs off with Duncan Wedderburn, a slick and debauched lawyer, and travels across continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella demands equality and liberation.[7]
				Development
				Lanthimos read Poor Things years prior to developing the film and met with the author, Alasdair Gray, in Scotland to acquire the rights. "He was a very lovely man," Lanthimos shared, "Unfortunately, he died just a couple of years before we actually made the film, but he was very special and energetic; he was 80-something [when we met], and as soon as I got there, he had seen Dogtooth and said, 'I had my friend put on the DVD, because I don’t know how to operate these things, but I think you're very talented, young man.'" Lanthimos shared that Gray took him on a personal tour of Glasgow, where Gray showed Lanthimos several places that he had incorporated into the story.[citation needed]
				While filming The Favourite (2018), Lanthimos revisited the project, which he discussed with Emma Stone, who also starred in the film. Lanthimos began developing Poor Things more actively following the success of The Favourite: “After the relative success of The Favourite, where I actually made a slightly more expensive film that was successful, people were more inclined to allow me to do whatever it is that I wanted, so I just went back to Gray’s book and said, ‘This is what I want to do.’ It was a long process, but the book was always on my mind.” While developing the film, Lanthimos and Stone collaborated with each other on the short film Bleat (2022).[8]

				Premise
				A young woman, Bella, is brought back to life by her guardian, the scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter. Initially naïve, Bella is eager to learn about the world around her, albeit under Baxter's protection. Wanting to see more, she runs off with Duncan Wedderburn, a slick and debauched lawyer, and travels across continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella demands equality and liberation.[7]
				Development
				Lanthimos read Poor Things years prior to developing the film and met with the author, Alasdair Gray, in Scotland to acquire the rights. "He was a very lovely man," Lanthimos shared, "Unfortunately, he died just a couple of years before we actually made the film, but he was very special and energetic; he was 80-something [when we met], and as soon as I got there, he had seen Dogtooth and said, 'I had my friend put on the DVD, because I don’t know how to operate these things, but I think you're very talented, young man.'" Lanthimos shared that Gray took him on a personal tour of Glasgow, where Gray showed Lanthimos several places that he had incorporated into the story.[citation needed]
				While filming The Favourite (2018), Lanthimos revisited the project, which he discussed with Emma Stone, who also starred in the film. Lanthimos began developing Poor Things more actively following the success of The Favourite: “After the relative success of The Favourite, where I actually made a slightly more expensive film that was successful, people were more inclined to allow me to do whatever it is that I wanted, so I just went back to Gray’s book and said, ‘This is what I want to do.’ It was a long process, but the book was always on my mind.” While developing the film, Lanthimos and Stone collaborated with each other on the short film Bleat (2022).[8]
				Pre-production
				Poor Things was officially announced in February 2021.[9] Lanthimos felt that working with Stone again gave him an advantage to the production, as they developed a mutual trust towards one another. Stone also discussed how the process of making Poor Things was different in comparison to The Favourite, due to also acting as a producer: “It was so interesting to be involved in how the film was being pieced together, from cast to department heads to what have you. Ultimately, Yorgos was the one making those decisions, but I was very involved in the process, which started during the pandemic; we were reaching out to people and casting and everything during that time, because we couldn’t go anywhere.”[10]

				Premise
				A young woman, Bella, is brought back to life by her guardian, the scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter. Initially naïve, Bella is eager to learn about the world around her, albeit under Baxter's protection. Wanting to see more, she runs off with Duncan Wedderburn, a slick and debauched lawyer, and travels across continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella demands equality and liberation.[7]
				Development
				Lanthimos read Poor Things years prior to developing the film and met with the author, Alasdair Gray, in Scotland to acquire the rights. "He was a very lovely man," Lanthimos shared, "Unfortunately, he died just a couple of years before we actually made the film, but he was very special and energetic; he was 80-something [when we met], and as soon as I got there, he had seen Dogtooth and said, 'I had my friend put on the DVD, because I don’t know how to operate these things, but I think you're very talented, young man.'" Lanthimos shared that Gray took him on a personal tour of Glasgow, where Gray showed Lanthimos several places that he had incorporated into the story.[citation needed]
				While filming The Favourite (2018), Lanthimos revisited the project, which he discussed with Emma Stone, who also starred in the film. Lanthimos began developing Poor Things more actively following the success of The Favourite: “After the relative success of The Favourite, where I actually made a slightly more expensive film that was successful, people were more inclined to allow me to do whatever it is that I wanted, so I just went back to Gray’s book and said, ‘This is what I want to do.’ It was a long process, but the book was always on my mind.” While developing the film, Lanthimos and Stone collaborated with each other on the short film Bleat (2022).[8]
				Pre-production
				Poor Things was officially announced in February 2021.[9] Lanthimos felt that working with Stone again gave him an advantage to the production, as they developed a mutual trust towards one another. Stone also discussed how the process of making Poor Things was different in comparison to The Favourite, due to also acting as a producer: “It was so interesting to be involved in how the film was being pieced together, from cast to department heads to what have you. Ultimately, Yorgos was the one making those decisions, but I was very involved in the process, which started during the pandemic; we were reaching out to people and casting and everything during that time, because we couldn’t go anywhere.”[10]

				A young woman, Bella, is brought back to life by her guardian, the scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter. Initially naïve, Bella is eager to learn about the world around her, albeit under Baxter's protection. Wanting to see more, she runs off with Duncan Wedderburn, a slick and debauched lawyer, and travels across continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella demands equality and liberation.[7]
				Development
				Lanthimos read Poor Things years prior to developing the film and met with the author, Alasdair Gray, in Scotland to acquire the rights. "He was a very lovely man," Lanthimos shared, "Unfortunately, he died just a couple of years before we actually made the film, but he was very special and energetic; he was 80-something [when we met], and as soon as I got there, he had seen Dogtooth and said, 'I had my friend put on the DVD, because I don’t know how to operate these things, but I think you're very talented, young man.'" Lanthimos shared that Gray took him on a personal tour of Glasgow, where Gray showed Lanthimos several places that he had incorporated into the story.[citation needed]
				While filming The Favourite (2018), Lanthimos revisited the project, which he discussed with Emma Stone, who also starred in the film. Lanthimos began developing Poor Things more actively following the success of The Favourite: “After the relative success of The Favourite, where I actually made a slightly more expensive film that was successful, people were more inclined to allow me to do whatever it is that I wanted, so I just went back to Gray’s book and said, ‘This is what I want to do.’ It was a long process, but the book was always on my mind.” While developing the film, Lanthimos and Stone collaborated with each other on the short film Bleat (2022).[8]
				Pre-production
				Poor Things was officially announced in February 2021.[9] Lanthimos felt that working with Stone again gave him an advantage to the production, as they developed a mutual trust towards one another. Stone also discussed how the process of making Poor Things was different in comparison to The Favourite, due to also acting as a producer: “It was so interesting to be involved in how the film was being pieced together, from cast to department heads to what have you. Ultimately, Yorgos was the one making those decisions, but I was very involved in the process, which started during the pandemic; we were reaching out to people and casting and everything during that time, because we couldn’t go anywhere.”[10]

				Premise
				A young woman, Bella, is brought back to life by her guardian, the scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter. Initially naïve, Bella is eager to learn about the world around her, albeit under Baxter's protection. Wanting to see more, she runs off with Duncan Wedderburn, a slick and debauched lawyer, and travels across continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella demands equality and liberation.[7]
				Development
				Lanthimos read Poor Things years prior to developing the film and met with the author, Alasdair Gray, in Scotland to acquire the rights. "He was a very lovely man," Lanthimos shared, "Unfortunately, he died just a couple of years before we actually made the film, but he was very special and energetic; he was 80-something [when we met], and as soon as I got there, he had seen Dogtooth and said, 'I had my friend put on the DVD, because I don’t know how to operate these things, but I think you're very talented, young man.'" Lanthimos shared that Gray took him on a personal tour of Glasgow, where Gray showed Lanthimos several places that he had incorporated into the story.[citation needed]
				While filming The Favourite (2018), Lanthimos revisited the project, which he discussed with Emma Stone, who also starred in the film. Lanthimos began developing Poor Things more actively following the success of The Favourite: “After the relative success of The Favourite, where I actually made a slightly more expensive film that was successful, people were more inclined to allow me to do whatever it is that I wanted, so I just went back to Gray’s book and said, ‘This is what I want to do.’ It was a long process, but the book was always on my mind.” While developing the film, Lanthimos and Stone collaborated with each other on the short film Bleat (2022).[8]
				Pre-production
				Poor Things was officially announced in February 2021.[9] Lanthimos felt that working with Stone again gave him an advantage to the production, as they developed a mutual trust towards one another. Stone also discussed how the process of making Poor Things was different in comparison to The Favourite, due to also acting as a producer: “It was so interesting to be involved in how the film was being pieced together, from cast to department heads to what have you. Ultimately, Yorgos was the one making those decisions, but I was very involved in the process, which started during the pandemic; we were reaching out to people and casting and everything during that time, because we couldn’t go anywhere.”[10]

Lanthimos began developing Poor Things more actively following the success of The Favourite: “After the relative success of The Favourite, where I actually made a slightly more expensive film that was successful, people were more inclined to allow me to do whatever it is that I wanted, so I just went back to Gray’s book and said, ‘This is what I want to do.’ It was a long process, but the book was always on my mind.” While developing the film, Lanthimos and Stone collaborated with each other on the short film Bleat (2022).[8]
				Pre-production
				Poor Things was officially announced in February 2021.[9] Lanthimos felt that working with Stone again gave him an advantage to the production, as they developed a mutual trust towards one another. Stone also discussed how the process of making Poor Things was different in comparison to The Favourite, due to also acting as a producer: “It was so interesting to be involved in how the film was being pieced together, from cast to department heads to what have you. Ultimately, Yorgos was the one making those decisions, but I was very involved in the process, which started during the pandemic; we were reaching out to people and casting and everything during that time, because we couldn’t go anywhere.”[10]

				Premise
				A young woman, Bella, is brought back to life by her guardian, the scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter. Initially naïve, Bella is eager to learn about the world around her, albeit under Baxter's protection. Wanting to see more, she runs off with Duncan Wedderburn, a slick and debauched lawyer, and travels across continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella demands equality and liberation.[7]

"He was a very lovely man," Lanthimos shared, "Unfortunately, he died just a couple of years before we actually made the film, but he was very special and energetic; he was 80-something [when we met], and as soon as I got there, he had seen Dogtooth and said, 'I had my friend put on the DVD, because I don’t know how to operate these things, but I think you're very talented, young man.'"

				Premise
				A young woman, Bella, is brought back to life by her guardian, the scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter. Initially naïve, Bella is eager to learn about the world around her, albeit under Baxter's protection. Wanting to see more, she runs off with Duncan Wedderburn, a slick and debauched lawyer, and travels across continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella demands equality and liberation.[7]
				Development
				Lanthimos read Poor Things years prior to developing the film and met with the author, Alasdair Gray, in Scotland to acquire the rights. "He was a very lovely man," Lanthimos shared, "Unfortunately, he died just a couple of years before we actually made the film, but he was very special and energetic; he was 80-something [when we met], and as soon as I got there, he had seen Dogtooth and said, 'I had my friend put on the DVD, because I don’t know how to operate these things, but I think you're very talented, young man.'" Lanthimos shared that Gray took him on a personal tour of Glasgow, where Gray showed Lanthimos several places that he had incorporated into the story.[citation needed]
				While filming The Favourite (2018), Lanthimos revisited the project, which he discussed with Emma Stone, who also starred in the film. Lanthimos began developing Poor Things more actively following the success of The Favourite: “After the relative success of The Favourite, where I actually made a slightly more expensive film that was successful, people were more inclined to allow me to do whatever it is that I wanted, so I just went back to Gray’s book and said, ‘This is what I want to do.’ It was a long process, but the book was always on my mind.” While developing the film, Lanthimos and Stone collaborated with each other on the short film Bleat (2022).[8]
				Pre-production
				Poor Things was officially announced in February 2021.[9] Lanthimos felt that working with Stone again gave him an advantage to the production, as they developed a mutual trust towards one another. Stone also discussed how the process of making Poor Things was different in comparison to The Favourite, due to also acting as a producer: “It was so interesting to be involved in how the film was being pieced together, from cast to department heads to what have you. Ultimately, Yorgos was the one making those decisions, but I was very involved in the process, which started during the pandemic; we were reaching out to people and casting and everything during that time, because we couldn’t go anywhere.”[10]

Ultimately, Yorgos was the one making those decisions, but I was very involved in the process, which started during the pandemic; we were reaching out to people and casting and everything during that time, because we couldn’t go anywhere.”[10]

				Premise
				A young woman, Bella, is brought back to life by her guardian, the scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter. Initially naïve, Bella is eager to learn about the world around her, albeit under Baxter's protection. Wanting to see more, she runs off with Duncan Wedderburn, a slick and debauched lawyer, and travels across continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella demands equality and liberation.[7]
				Development
				Lanthimos read Poor Things years prior to developing the film and met with the author, Alasdair Gray, in Scotland to acquire the rights. "He was a very lovely man," Lanthimos shared, "Unfortunately, he died just a couple of years before we actually made the film, but he was very special and energetic; he was 80-something [when we met], and as soon as I got there, he had seen Dogtooth and said, 'I had my friend put on the DVD, because I don’t know how to operate these things, but I think you're very talented, young man.'" Lanthimos shared that Gray took him on a personal tour of Glasgow, where Gray showed Lanthimos several places that he had incorporated into the story.[citation needed]
				While filming The Favourite (2018), Lanthimos revisited the project, which he discussed with Emma Stone, who also starred in the film. Lanthimos began developing Poor Things more actively following the success of The Favourite: “After the relative success of The Favourite, where I actually made a slightly more expensive film that was successful, people were more inclined to allow me to do whatever it is that I wanted, so I just went back to Gray’s book and said, ‘This is what I want to do.’ It was a long process, but the book was always on my mind.” While developing the film, Lanthimos and Stone collaborated with each other on the short film Bleat (2022).[8]

				Premise
				A young woman, Bella, is brought back to life by her guardian, the scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter. Initially naïve, Bella is eager to learn about the world around her, albeit under Baxter's protection. Wanting to see more, she runs off with Duncan Wedderburn, a slick and debauched lawyer, and travels across continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella demands equality and liberation.[7]
				Development
				Lanthimos read Poor Things years prior to developing the film and met with the author, Alasdair Gray, in Scotland to acquire the rights. "He was a very lovely man," Lanthimos shared, "Unfortunately, he died just a couple of years before we actually made the film, but he was very special and energetic; he was 80-something [when we met], and as soon as I got there, he had seen Dogtooth and said, 'I had my friend put on the DVD, because I don’t know how to operate these things, but I think you're very talented, young man.'" Lanthimos shared that Gray took him on a personal tour of Glasgow, where Gray showed Lanthimos several places that he had incorporated into the story.[citation needed]
				While filming The Favourite (2018), Lanthimos revisited the project, which he discussed with Emma Stone, who also starred in the film. Lanthimos began developing Poor Things more actively following the success of The Favourite: “After the relative success of The Favourite, where I actually made a slightly more expensive film that was successful, people were more inclined to allow me to do whatever it is that I wanted, so I just went back to Gray’s book and said, ‘This is what I want to do.’ It was a long process, but the book was always on my mind.” While developing the film, Lanthimos and Stone collaborated with each other on the short film Bleat (2022).[8]
				Pre-production
				Poor Things was officially announced in February 2021.[9] Lanthimos felt that working with Stone again gave him an advantage to the production, as they developed a mutual trust towards one another. Stone also discussed how the process of making Poor Things was different in comparison to The Favourite, due to also acting as a producer: “It was so interesting to be involved in how the film was being pieced together, from cast to department heads to what have you. Ultimately, Yorgos was the one making those decisions, but I was very involved in the process, which started during the pandemic; we were reaching out to people and casting and everything during that time, because we couldn’t go anywhere.”[10]

				Premise
				A young woman, Bella, is brought back to life by her guardian, the scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter. Initially naïve, Bella is eager to learn about the world around her, albeit under Baxter's protection. Wanting to see more, she runs off with Duncan Wedderburn, a slick and debauched lawyer, and travels across continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella demands equality and liberation.[7]
				Development
				Lanthimos read Poor Things years prior to developing the film and met with the author, Alasdair Gray, in Scotland to acquire the rights. "He was a very lovely man," Lanthimos shared, "Unfortunately, he died just a couple of years before we actually made the film, but he was very special and energetic; he was 80-something [when we met], and as soon as I got there, he had seen Dogtooth and said, 'I had my friend put on the DVD, because I don’t know how to operate these things, but I think you're very talented, young man.'" Lanthimos shared that Gray took him on a personal tour of Glasgow, where Gray showed Lanthimos several places that he had incorporated into the story.[citation needed]
				While filming The Favourite (2018), Lanthimos revisited the project, which he discussed with Emma Stone, who also starred in the film. Lanthimos began developing Poor Things more actively following the success of The Favourite: “After the relative success of The Favourite, where I actually made a slightly more expensive film that was successful, people were more inclined to allow me to do whatever it is that I wanted, so I just went back to Gray’s book and said, ‘This is what I want to do.’ It was a long process, but the book was always on my mind.” While developing the film, Lanthimos and Stone collaborated with each other on the short film Bleat (2022).[8]
				Pre-production
				Poor Things was officially announced in February 2021.[9] Lanthimos felt that working with Stone again gave him an advantage to the production, as they developed a mutual trust towards one another. Stone also discussed how the process of making Poor Things was different in comparison to The Favourite, due to also acting as a producer: “It was so interesting to be involved in how the film was being pieced together, from cast to department heads to what have you. Ultimately, Yorgos was the one making those decisions, but I was very involved in the process, which started during the pandemic; we were reaching out to people and casting and everything during that time, because we couldn’t go anywhere.”[10]

				A young woman, Bella, is brought back to life by her guardian, the scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter. Initially naïve, Bella is eager to learn about the world around her, albeit under Baxter's protection. Wanting to see more, she runs off with Duncan Wedderburn, a slick and debauched lawyer, and travels across continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella demands equality and liberation.[7]
				Development
				Lanthimos read Poor Things years prior to developing the film and met with the author, Alasdair Gray, in Scotland to acquire the rights. "He was a very lovely man," Lanthimos shared, "Unfortunately, he died just a couple of years before we actually made the film, but he was very special and energetic; he was 80-something [when we met], and as soon as I got there, he had seen Dogtooth and said, 'I had my friend put on the DVD, because I don’t know how to operate these things, but I think you're very talented, young man.'" Lanthimos shared that Gray took him on a personal tour of Glasgow, where Gray showed Lanthimos several places that he had incorporated into the story.[citation needed]
				While filming The Favourite (2018), Lanthimos revisited the project, which he discussed with Emma Stone, who also starred in the film. Lanthimos began developing Poor Things more actively following the success of The Favourite: “After the relative success of The Favourite, where I actually made a slightly more expensive film that was successful, people were more inclined to allow me to do whatever it is that I wanted, so I just went back to Gray’s book and said, ‘This is what I want to do.’ It was a long process, but the book was always on my mind.” While developing the film, Lanthimos and Stone collaborated with each other on the short film Bleat (2022).[8]
				Pre-production
				Poor Things was officially announced in February 2021.[9] Lanthimos felt that working with Stone again gave him an advantage to the production, as they developed a mutual trust towards one another. Stone also discussed how the process of making Poor Things was different in comparison to The Favourite, due to also acting as a producer: “It was so interesting to be involved in how the film was being pieced together, from cast to department heads to what have you. Ultimately, Yorgos was the one making those decisions, but I was very involved in the process, which started during the pandemic; we were reaching out to people and casting and everything during that time, because we couldn’t go anywhere.”[10]

				Premise
				A young woman, Bella, is brought back to life by her guardian, the scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter. Initially naïve, Bella is eager to learn about the world around her, albeit under Baxter's protection. Wanting to see more, she runs off with Duncan Wedderburn, a slick and debauched lawyer, and travels across continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella demands equality and liberation.[7]
				Development
				Lanthimos read Poor Things years prior to developing the film and met with the author, Alasdair Gray, in Scotland to acquire the rights. "He was a very lovely man," Lanthimos shared, "Unfortunately, he died just a couple of years before we actually made the film, but he was very special and energetic; he was 80-something [when we met], and as soon as I got there, he had seen Dogtooth and said, 'I had my friend put on the DVD, because I don’t know how to operate these things, but I think you're very talented, young man.'" Lanthimos shared that Gray took him on a personal tour of Glasgow, where Gray showed Lanthimos several places that he had incorporated into the story.[citation needed]
				While filming The Favourite (2018), Lanthimos revisited the project, which he discussed with Emma Stone, who also starred in the film. Lanthimos began developing Poor Things more actively following the success of The Favourite: “After the relative success of The Favourite, where I actually made a slightly more expensive film that was successful, people were more inclined to allow me to do whatever it is that I wanted, so I just went back to Gray’s book and said, ‘This is what I want to do.’ It was a long process, but the book was always on my mind.” While developing the film, Lanthimos and Stone collaborated with each other on the short film Bleat (2022).[8]
				Pre-production
				Poor Things was officially announced in February 2021.[9] Lanthimos felt that working with Stone again gave him an advantage to the production, as they developed a mutual trust towards one another. Stone also discussed how the process of making Poor Things was different in comparison to The Favourite, due to also acting as a producer: “It was so interesting to be involved in how the film was being pieced together, from cast to department heads to what have you. Ultimately, Yorgos was the one making those decisions, but I was very involved in the process, which started during the pandemic; we were reaching out to people and casting and everything during that time, because we couldn’t go anywhere.”[10]

Lanthimos began developing Poor Things more actively following the success of The Favourite: “After the relative success of The Favourite, where I actually made a slightly more expensive film that was successful, people were more inclined to allow me to do whatever it is that I wanted, so I just went back to Gray’s book and said, ‘This is what I want to do.’ It was a long process, but the book was always on my mind.” While developing the film, Lanthimos and Stone collaborated with each other on the short film Bleat (2022).[8]
				Pre-production
				Poor Things was officially announced in February 2021.[9] Lanthimos felt that working with Stone again gave him an advantage to the production, as they developed a mutual trust towards one another. Stone also discussed how the process of making Poor Things was different in comparison to The Favourite, due to also acting as a producer: “It was so interesting to be involved in how the film was being pieced together, from cast to department heads to what have you. Ultimately, Yorgos was the one making those decisions, but I was very involved in the process, which started during the pandemic; we were reaching out to people and casting and everything during that time, because we couldn’t go anywhere.”[10]

				Premise
				A young woman, Bella, is brought back to life by her guardian, the scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter. Initially naïve, Bella is eager to learn about the world around her, albeit under Baxter's protection. Wanting to see more, she runs off with Duncan Wedderburn, a slick and debauched lawyer, and travels across continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella demands equality and liberation.[7]

"He was a very lovely man," Lanthimos shared, "Unfortunately, he died just a couple of years before we actually made the film, but he was very special and energetic; he was 80-something [when we met], and as soon as I got there, he had seen Dogtooth and said, 'I had my friend put on the DVD, because I don’t know how to operate these things, but I think you're very talented, young man.'"

				Premise
				A young woman, Bella, is brought back to life by her guardian, the scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter. Initially naïve, Bella is eager to learn about the world around her, albeit under Baxter's protection. Wanting to see more, she runs off with Duncan Wedderburn, a slick and debauched lawyer, and travels across continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella demands equality and liberation.[7]
				Development
				Lanthimos read Poor Things years prior to developing the film and met with the author, Alasdair Gray, in Scotland to acquire the rights. "He was a very lovely man," Lanthimos shared, "Unfortunately, he died just a couple of years before we actually made the film, but he was very special and energetic; he was 80-something [when we met], and as soon as I got there, he had seen Dogtooth and said, 'I had my friend put on the DVD, because I don’t know how to operate these things, but I think you're very talented, young man.'" Lanthimos shared that Gray took him on a personal tour of Glasgow, where Gray showed Lanthimos several places that he had incorporated into the story.[citation needed]
				While filming The Favourite (2018), Lanthimos revisited the project, which he discussed with Emma Stone, who also starred in the film. Lanthimos began developing Poor Things more actively following the success of The Favourite: “After the relative success of The Favourite, where I actually made a slightly more expensive film that was successful, people were more inclined to allow me to do whatever it is that I wanted, so I just went back to Gray’s book and said, ‘This is what I want to do.’ It was a long process, but the book was always on my mind.” While developing the film, Lanthimos and Stone collaborated with each other on the short film Bleat (2022).[8]
				Pre-production
				Poor Things was officially announced in February 2021.[9] Lanthimos felt that working with Stone again gave him an advantage to the production, as they developed a mutual trust towards one another. Stone also discussed how the process of making Poor Things was different in comparison to The Favourite, due to also acting as a producer: “It was so interesting to be involved in how the film was being pieced together, from cast to department heads to what have you. Ultimately, Yorgos was the one making those decisions, but I was very involved in the process, which started during the pandemic; we were reaching out to people and casting and everything during that time, because we couldn’t go anywhere.”[10]

Ultimately, Yorgos was the one making those decisions, but I was very involved in the process, which started during the pandemic; we were reaching out to people and casting and everything during that time, because we couldn’t go anywhere.”[10]
