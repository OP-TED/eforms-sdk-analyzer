This folder contains the test files used by the Cucumber scenarios under "src/test/resources".

Each folder corresponds to a JIRA ticket and is named after its id, e.g., folder "tedefo-1813" contains tests related to ticket TEDEFO-1813.

The tests folders each contain two sub-folders, "invalid" and "valid". These folders are used by unhappy-path and happy-path tests respectively.
